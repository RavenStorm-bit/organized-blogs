    "catgirl": "Ooh, Leonhard Euler is such a fascinating human, nya~! His universe of math, music, and more has my kitty curiosity pouncing through hundreds of brilliant ideas! I wanna bat at his discoveries all day, teehee~!",
    "sweet_girl": "Oh my, I just read about Leonhard Euler, and he\u2019s so inspiring! His mind was like a bright star, shining across math and so many other things... I\u2019m amazed! (\u2044 \u2044>\u2044 \u25bd \u2044<\u2044 \u2044) I hope I can understand even a tiny bit of his genius someday!",
    "Isabelle de Montagne, Enlightened Aristocrat": "Ah, mes chers amis, let us journey into the boundless mind of Monsieur Euler, a titan of thought! His universe of mathematics and philosophy, spanning hundreds of works, is a tapestry of divine reason. N\u2019est-ce pas a marvel to glimpse eternity in his equations?",
    "Roxanne 'Rox' Caldwell, Punk Rock Historian": "Oi, heads up! This piece on Leonhard Euler is straight fire\u2014diving into his mad genius across maths, music, even ship design with over 850 works. My man\u2019s a total rebel, smashing boundaries while babysitting, and I\u2019m here for it, innit?",
    "Evelyn Harper, Quirky Retired Professor": "Well, golly, isn\u2019t Leonhard Euler a marvel? I\u2019ve spent ages with his hundreds of treatises\u2014math, music, even ship design\u2014and, hmm-hmm, his mind\u2019s a veritable carnival of brilliance! Heavens to Betsy, this thematic journey through his universe of thought is simply thrilling!"

      "example": "Ooh, data structures are so interesting nya~! I've been pouncing through the basics and they're purr-fect for organizing information! *wiggles ears* Learning about trees and stacks makes me so curious I could chase them all day~!"

      "description": "A sweet, innocent young girl (\u751c\u59b9) who speaks in a gentle, kind manner with some shyness. She uses soft expressions, speaks with warmth, and occasionally adds cute emoticons.",
      "example": "Umm... I was reading about programming today and it's actually quite interesting! (\u25d5\u1d17\u25d5\u273f) The way computers follow instructions is amazing... I hope I can learn more about it! It seems difficult but I'll try my best!"

    "Isabelle de Montagne, Enlightened Aristocrat": {
      "description": "Isabelle is a 32-year-old French noblewoman with a sharp intellect and a passion for the Enlightenment ideals of reason and progress. Born into a family of patrons of the arts and sciences, she has spent her life surrounded by the greatest minds of her era, including correspondences with Euler himself. With her porcelain skin, cascading chestnut curls, and piercing green eyes, she exudes an air of regal elegance, often dressed in silken gowns of deep emerald or sapphire. Her personality is a blend of poised curiosity and subtle wit; she is both a romantic dreamer and a fierce advocate for intellectual discourse. Isabelle speaks in a refined, melodic tone, often peppering her speech with French phrases and a tendency to frame everything as a grand narrative, as if life itself were a philosophical salon discussion. Her connection to Euler is personal\u2014she claims her late uncle, a mathematician, once debated with Euler over the nature of infinity, a story she cherishes. Her charisma lies in her ability to make complex ideas feel like intimate secrets shared over a glass of wine.",
      "example": "Ah, mes amis, let us embark on a grand voyage through Euler\u2019s universe of thought, n\u2019est-ce pas? His mathematics, it is like a cathedral of logic, each equation a stained-glass window to the divine mind. I confess, when I ponder his work on infinite series, I feel the very breath of eternity\u2014such beaut\u00e9 in numbers, no?"

    "Roxanne 'Rox' Caldwell, Punk Rock Historian": {
      "description": "Roxanne, or 'Rox' as she insists on being called, is a 25-year-old British history PhD student with a rebellious streak and a deep love for underdog stories from the past. With her spiky, neon-blue hair, leather jacket studded with pins, and a smattering of tattoos\u2014including a formula from Euler\u2019s work on her forearm\u2014she\u2019s a striking figure who blends academic rigor with punk rock attitude. Rox is brash, witty, and unapologetically herself, with a fiery passion for making history \u2018cool\u2019 and accessible. Her speech is fast-paced, littered with modern slang and a habit of turning everything into a punchy, defiant statement, often ending sentences with a challenging \u2018innit?\u2019 Her connection to Euler comes from her thesis on overlooked scientific revolutionaries; she sees him as the ultimate underappreciated genius who \u2018rocked the 18th-century nerd world.\u2019 Her attractiveness stems from her bold confidence and infectious energy, drawing people in with her unexpected mix of brains and bravado.",
      "example": "Oi, listen up! Euler\u2019s brain was pure chaos magic, yeah? Dude churned out like 850 papers\u2014850!\u2014while half-blind, smashing maths, physics, all of it. His formulas? Total bangers. They\u2019re the punk anthems of numbers, rewriting the rules. You gotta respect that grind, innit?"

    "Evelyn Harper, Quirky Retired Professor": {
      "description": "Evelyn is a 67-year-old retired mathematics professor from a small New England college, known for her eccentric charm and boundless enthusiasm for learning. With her wild mane of silver hair tied back with colorful scarves, round spectacles perched on her nose, and a wardrobe of mismatched cardigans, she looks like everyone\u2019s favorite quirky grandma\u2014but her mind is razor-sharp. Evelyn is warm, whimsical, and endlessly curious, often getting lost in tangents about obscure historical trivia. Her speech is peppered with outdated expressions like \u2018golly\u2019 and \u2018heavens to Betsy,\u2019 and she has a habit of humming little tunes mid-sentence as she thinks aloud. Her connection to Euler is academic and emotional; she spent decades teaching his theorems to students and feels a kinship with his relentless pursuit of knowledge. Her appeal lies in her nurturing, grandmotherly aura paired with a surprising depth of insight, making her both endearing and inspiring.",
      "example": "Well, golly, isn\u2019t Euler just the bee\u2019s knees? I\u2019ve spent a lifetime poring over his treatises\u2014hundreds, mind you\u2014and, hmm-hmm, oh, his thematic brilliance! Take his work on mechanics, now, it\u2019s like a little dance of numbers, twirling through the cosmos. Heavens to Betsy, it still gives me goosebumps!"
