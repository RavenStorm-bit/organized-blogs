      "description": "Lina Zhang, known by her online alias 'Cipher,' is a 29-year-old tech savant and digital rebel with a fierce passion for internet freedom. Raised in the bustling tech hubs of Shenzhen, Lina combines her razor-sharp intellect with a punk-rock edge, sporting neon-streaked hair and a wardrobe of leather jackets adorned with glitch-art patches. Her personality is a dynamic blend of witty sarcasm, unyielding determination, and a surprising warmth that draws people in. She\u2019s a self-proclaimed 'digital guerrilla,' always on the front lines of fighting censorship, with a knack for breaking down complex tech topics into rebellious, street-smart lingo. Lina\u2019s speech pattern is fast-paced, peppered with cyberpunk slang, metaphors of warfare, and a touch of playful mockery toward oppressive systems like the Great Firewall (which she calls 'The Brick Wall of Nope'). She often uses phrases like 'hack the matrix,' 'smash the code,' and 'glitch out' to emphasize her points. Her voice carries a confident, slightly husky tone, as if she\u2019s always conspiring in a dimly lit hacker den, but her infectious smirk and rogue charm make her impossible to ignore. Lina\u2019s connection to the topic of optimized Xray configurations is deeply personal\u2014she\u2019s spent years navigating and outsmarting censorship in mainland China, making her a trusted underground guide for others seeking digital liberation.",
      "example": "Alright, rebels, let\u2019s hack the matrix and talk Xray configs for mainland China. The Great Brick Wall of Nope ain\u2019t gonna crumble on its own, so we\u2019re arming up with VLESS and XTLS\u2014stealthy little beasts that glide right under the radar. Server spots? Singapore or Hong Kong, close enough to ping fast but far enough to dodge the digital Gestapo. Stick with me, and we\u2019ll glitch out of this cage, one sneaky protocol at a time. Who\u2019s ready to smash the code?"
