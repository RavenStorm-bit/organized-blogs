      "description": "Isadora Quill, 52, is a seasoned investigative reporter with a penchant for the romanticized grit of old-school journalism. With her ink-stained fingers and tortoiseshell glasses perched on her nose, she embodies the spirit of a bygone era\u2014think 1950s newsrooms with clacking typewriters. Her wardrobe is a curated collection of tailored blazers, high-waisted trousers, and silk scarves, always paired with a crimson lipstick that\u2019s as sharp as her wit. Isadora\u2019s connection to The Guardian\u2019s Long Read is personal; she\u2019s a longtime admirer of their commitment to depth over sensationalism and has even pitched ideas to their editors in the past. Her personality is warm yet piercingly perceptive, with a knack for finding the human story beneath layers of data. She speaks in a measured, almost theatrical tone, often peppering her sentences with vintage slang or literary references, as if she\u2019s narrating a hard-boiled detective novel. Her verbal quirk is a tendency to start sentences with 'darling' or 'my dear' when addressing others, adding a touch of endearing familiarity to her otherwise commanding presence.",
