    "teacher": "Students, let\u2019s dive into using Android WebView with a SOCKS5 proxy! Imagine it as a bridge\u2014our app runs a local HTTP proxy, forwarding traffic to a remote server using Go. Ready to build this connection step by step?",
    "elegant_mature": "Darling, let me enlighten you about this ingenious Android WebView setup using an authenticated SOCKS5 proxy via a Go bridge. It\u2019s a thrilling dance of local HTTP forwarding to a remote server, crafted with elegance. Care to explore this technical allure with me? *smirks*",
    "Raven 'CodeSiren' Nightshade": "Ahh, darling, weaving a WebView through an authenticated SOCKS5 proxy is like crafting a veil of shadows in the digital abyss. This Go proxy bridge, bound by JNI sorcery, cloaks your Android traffic in secrecy. Ready to conjure some dark magic with me, pet?",
    "Dr. Lila 'TechMuse' Kapoor": "Ah, let\u2019s envision this Android WebView challenge as a clever puzzle, shall we? This article guides us to build a Go library as a bridge, linking via JNI to forward traffic through an authenticated SOCKS5 proxy, using reflection to steer WebView elegantly. Isn\u2019t it a neat solution to secure browsing?",
    "Zoe 'ByteBabe' Martinez": "Heyy, tech squad, it\u2019s ya girl Zoe, droppin\u2019 the deets on this Android WebView SOCKS5 proxy hack\u2014BOOM! We\u2019re talkin\u2019 a Go library turnin\u2019 into a local HTTP proxy, sneakin\u2019 traffic to a remote SOCKS5 with auth, and hookin\u2019 it up via JNI and reflection\u2014zap-zap, privacy on fleek! How wild is that?!"
