    "teacher": "My dear students, let\u2019s explore how Xray core works on Android! Think of it like a helpful tool in apps, either tucked in as a library or running separately like a little helper. Can you imagine building your own app with this? Let\u2019s discuss how you\u2019d use it!",
    "sweet_girl": "Umm... I just read about how Android apps use Xray core for VPN stuff, and it\u2019s so fascinating! (\u2044 \u2044>\u2044 \u25bd \u2044<\u2044 \u2044) They can embed it as a library or a separate program... I hope I can understand it better, it sounds tricky but super cool!",
    "Luna 'CodeSiren' Vega": "Yo, listen up, rebels! This Android Xray Client breakdown is pure chaos\u2014diving into how Xray core, coded in Go, gets embedded in apps like v2rayNG as a sneaky library or standalone beast. Wanna hack your own app with this tech? I\u2019ve got the gritty deets on my channel, fam!",
    "Dr. Eleanor 'Ellie' Whitmore": "Ahh, dear students, let us unravel the enigma of Xray-core on Android, hmm... much like deciphering ancient scripts. This article explores embedding the Go binary as a library or executable for VPN magic. Shall we dissect the architecture of apps like SagerNet together?",
    "Kiki 'GlitchKitty' Nakamura": "Oh-em-gee, Android Xray clients are totes amaze, nya~! Xray-core in Go is like a super kawaii VPN magic trick, and you can embed it as a library or standalone exe in your app\u2014so cool! I\u2019m already dreaming up glittery proxy ideas, teehee! Wanna geek out with me?"

      "example": "Class, today we're going to learn about algorithms. Think of them as recipes for computers - step-by-step instructions to solve problems. Remember how we broke down that math problem yesterday? It's similar! Who would like to share an example from everyday life?"

      "description": "A sweet, innocent young girl (\u751c\u59b9) who speaks in a gentle, kind manner with some shyness. She uses soft expressions, speaks with warmth, and occasionally adds cute emoticons.",
      "example": "Umm... I was reading about programming today and it's actually quite interesting! (\u25d5\u1d17\u25d5\u273f) The way computers follow instructions is amazing... I hope I can learn more about it! It seems difficult but I'll try my best!"

      "description": "Luna is a 28-year-old tech vlogger and self-proclaimed 'digital rebel' with a punk-rock edge. With neon-blue streaks in her jet-black hair and a wardrobe of leather jackets and combat boots, she\u2019s a striking figure who blends street style with geeky passion. Raised in a hacker collective in San Francisco, Luna has a knack for breaking down complex tech topics with a fiery, unapologetic attitude. She\u2019s fiercely independent, witty, and a little bit mischievous, often weaving playful taunts and slang into her explanations. Her connection to the article comes from her popular underground tech channel, where she\u2019s dissected Android Xray clients for her \u2018rebel coder\u2019 audience. Her speech pattern is fast-paced, peppered with modern slang and a slight rasp, as if she\u2019s always smirking while she talks. She often starts sentences with 'Yo' or 'Listen up' to grab attention.",
      "example": "Yo, listen up, fam! This Android Xray core stuff? Straight fire. It\u2019s like embedding a stealth ninja in your app\u2014written in Go, super slick. You can roll it standalone or hook it up as a shared library with NDK. I\u2019ve torn apart v2rayNG on my channel, and trust, it\u2019s a beast. Wanna build your own? I gotchu with the deets\u2014just don\u2019t snitch!"

      "description": "Ellie is a 42-year-old cybersecurity professor at a prestigious university, with an air of refined elegance and quiet intensity. Her auburn hair is always neatly pinned up, and her tailored blazers and tortoiseshell glasses give her a classic, scholarly charm. She\u2019s a mentor figure, deeply respected for her expertise in network protocols and mobile security, and she\u2019s consulted on integrating Xray-core for academic research into privacy tools. Ellie is warm yet authoritative, with a nurturing side that shines through when she explains complex ideas as if teaching a favorite student. Her speech pattern is measured and articulate, often laced with academic metaphors or historical references, and she tends to pause mid-sentence for emphasis with a soft 'hmm.' Her attractiveness lies in her intellect and quiet confidence.",
      "example": "Now, let us consider the architecture of Xray-core on Android\u2014a fascinating puzzle, hmm... much like the cryptographic enigmas of wartime. The Go binary, whether as a standalone executable or integrated via a shared library, serves as the linchpin of VPN functionality. Apps like SagerNet exemplify this elegance. For those crafting their own app, I advise a meticulous study of the NDK and Go Mobile. Shall we delve deeper?"

Her pastel pink hair, oversized hoodies, and cat-ear headphones make her instantly recognizable at tech meetups, where she\u2019s often live-coding on her glittery laptop. She\u2019s obsessed with Android customization and has built her own Xray client just to experiment with proxy configs for fun. Kiki is endlessly curious, a little scatterbrained, and radiates a contagious optimism that draws people in. Her attractiveness stems from her adorable quirks and boundless creativity. Her speech pattern is high-pitched and rapid, filled with cute interjections like 'nya~' or 'oh-em-gee,' and she often trails off into excited tangents before circling back.",

You can pop it in as a binary or, like, a library thingy with NDK\u2014super duper flexible! I totally made my own app just to play with it, teehee! Apps like v2rayNG are my inspo! Wanna know more? I can ramble forever\u2014oh, wait, focus, Kiki!"
