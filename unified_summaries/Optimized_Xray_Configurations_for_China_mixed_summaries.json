    "sweet_girl": "Oh, umm... I read about Xray configurations for mainland China, and it\u2019s so fascinating how they help bypass censorship! (\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\u273f) I hope these tips on protocols and setups can help people stay connected... I\u2019ll try to understand more!",
    "teacher": "My dear students, let\u2019s explore Xray configurations for mainland China, where bypassing censorship is like finding a hidden path through a maze. These setups, using protocols like VMess and Trojan, help ensure stable, secure internet access. Can you think of a time you had to find a clever workaround?",
    "Lina 'Tech Whisperer' Zhao": "Bypassing the Great Firewall is my kinda chess game\u2014every move\u2019s a cipher. Xray configs, with VLESS or Trojan, are my hidden blades, sharpened with XTLS and Reality for mainland China\u2019s shadows. Slip through with the right server, and the dragon never sees ya. Catch my drift?",
    "Mei-Ling 'Grandma Gearhead' Tan": "Ah, dearie, configurin\u2019 Xray to slip past the Great Firewall is like tending a sneaky little garden. Pick VMess or Trojan as yer hardy seeds, pair \u2018em with gRPC for deep roots, and plant yer server far from pryin\u2019 eyes. This old granny\u2019s recipe keeps yer internet bloomin\u2019 free!",
    "Xia 'Rebel Spark' Chen": "Yo, fam, let\u2019s talk Xray configs for crushin\u2019 the GFW in mainland China! This article\u2019s got the dope on protocols like VLESS and Trojan, sneaky transports, and server tricks to keep ya free online. I\u2019m usin\u2019 this to blast my art worldwide\u2014bam, no walls can hold me!"
