Understood. I’ll investigate in depth why Go-compiled binaries are difficult to run or integrate in Android apps, including:

- Why binaries placed in the assets folder fail with permission errors when moved to internal storage and executed.
- Why renaming a binary to `.so` and placing it in `lib/` doesn't make it usable from the app.
- What problems gomobile has when used on Windows 11 with AMD CPUs.
- How native libraries (Go vs C/C++) are expected to be integrated and invoked from Java/Kotlin code on Android.

I’ll also look into what the correct process is for using C/C++ code with Android apps if switching from Go becomes the better route.

I’ll let you know as soon as I have detailed answers and a recommended approach.

# Running Native Code in an Android App: Issues & Solutions

## Introduction & Problem Overview  
Developers sometimes need to use native code within an Android app – for example, a Go program or a C/C++ library – and call it from Java/Kotlin. The user attempted three approaches: 

1. **Executing a Go binary as an external process:** A Go program was cross-compiled to an Android-compatible binary. It ran fine when launched manually on the device. However, including this binary in the app’s assets, copying it to internal storage, and trying to execute it from Java/Kotlin failed with permission errors.  
2. **Packaging the Go binary as a `.so` library:** Renaming the binary to `libmylib.so` and placing it in the APK’s `lib/` directory (the usual location for native libraries) did not work – the app could not find or load the library at runtime.  
3. **Using `gomobile` to build an AAR (Android library archive):** This is the official Go Mobile tool for generating Java bindings and native libraries from Go code. The attempt ran into problems, possibly due to the development environment (Windows 11 on an AMD CPU), leaving the integration incomplete.  

The core goal is **not** to write a lot of new native code, but rather to **embed and invoke existing native code** (written in Go, or if necessary in C/C++) from an Android app. Below, we investigate each issue in depth and outline the correct methods to package and call native code on Android. We’ll also discuss the viability of the Go toolchain (`gomobile`) versus using the Android NDK with C/C++ (JNI), and provide recommendations for a reliable path forward.

## Executing Native Binaries on Android (Why It Fails)  
Attempting to execute an arbitrary binary from an Android app’s internal storage hits a security wall introduced in Android 10 (API level 29). As of that version, **Android enforces W^X (Write XOR Execute) memory policy on app storage**. In simple terms, if a file is in a location that the app can write to (like internal storage), the OS will not allow executing code from it ([java - How do you run an executable file located in the assets folder in android studio when the target SDK version is 29 or higher? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77708893/how-do-you-run-an-executable-file-located-in-the-assets-folder-in-android-studio#:~:text=,within%20an%20app%27s%20APK%20file)). This is by design to prevent apps (or malware) from downloading or modifying code at runtime and then executing it. The official Android 10 documentation states:

> “Execution of files from the writable app home directory is a W^X violation. Apps should load only the binary code that’s embedded within an app’s APK file.” ([java - How do you run an executable file located in the assets folder in android studio when the target SDK version is 29 or higher? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77708893/how-do-you-run-an-executable-file-located-in-the-assets-folder-in-android-studio#:~:text=,within%20an%20app%27s%20APK%20file))

 ([Add C and C++ code to your project  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code)) *Figure 1: Android APK containing native libraries for multiple architectures (viewed via the APK Analyzer). The `lib/` directory inside the APK holds subdirectories for each ABI (CPU architecture) – e.g., `arm64-v8a`, `x86_64`, etc. – each containing the appropriate `.so` files. These libraries are installed as part of the app and can be loaded/executed by the app at runtime. ([Add C and C++ code to your project  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code#:~:text=1,to%20update%20the%20%20218))* 

In our case, the Go binary placed in the app’s internal storage (`/data/data/<app>/files` or similar) is in a writable location. Trying to launch it via `ProcessBuilder` or `Runtime.exec()` leads to a **“Permission denied”** error (even if you call `chmod 755` on it). The OS simply disallows executing code from there when the app targets API 29+. An asset-packed binary, once extracted to internal storage, falls under this rule and is **not considered “embedded” code** in the APK ([java - How do you run an executable file located in the assets folder in android studio when the target SDK version is 29 or higher? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77708893/how-do-you-run-an-executable-file-located-in-the-assets-folder-in-android-studio#:~:text=embedded%20within%20an%20app%27s%20APK,file)). 

**Bottom line:** Modern Android versions will refuse to run executables from internal or external storage in apps. The only code allowed to run is: 
- Java/Kotlin code (in .dex or .apk), 
- Native code packaged in the APK’s **`lib/` directory** (as .so libraries), or 
- Code downloaded in certain controlled ways (e.g., dynamic feature modules or code via the Play Core library), which don’t apply here.

### Workarounds for Executables?  
For completeness, note that on older Android versions (API 28 and below) or on non-standard environments, one could sometimes get away with this approach by adjusting file permissions and using `exec()`. For example, some terminal apps (like Termux) shipped binaries in their private directories and executed them. But on a modern, security-hardened Android (and certainly on Google Play), this is no longer viable. Unless you have a rooted device or use an API level below 29 (not recommended), you **cannot directly execute your Go binary from internal storage**. Even adding manifest permissions for external storage or using a FileProvider (as the user attempted) won’t bypass the W^X restriction – it’s enforced at the OS level, not by file URI permissions.

**Solution:** The native code must be treated as part of the app’s packaged code. In practice, this means compiling it as a **shared library (.so)** and including it in the APK’s `lib/` folder, then loading it into the app’s process. The next sections detail how to do this properly.

## Packaging Native Code as a `.so` Library  
Since Android expects native code to be in library form, the user tried renaming the Go binary to `libmylib.so` and placing it under the APK’s lib folder. Simply renaming an executable file to `.so`, however, is **not sufficient** – the binary wasn’t recognized or loaded by the app. There are a few important points here:

- **Proper Compilation as a Shared Library:** A true `.so` library must be compiled as position-independent code (PIC) and usually of ELF type “DSO” (Dynamic Shared Object). A standalone Go executable is typically an ELF of type “EXEC” and may not be suitable for `dlopen` (the way Android loads libraries). Renaming doesn’t change the binary format. In short, the Go binary wasn’t built to be loaded as a library, so the system couldn’t load it. The correct approach with Go would be to compile with **`-buildmode=c-shared`** (which produces a .so with the Go runtime baked in) or use the Go mobile toolchain to create a .so. We’ll cover that soon.  

- **Packaging in the APK:** Android Studio/Gradle will only package libraries automatically if they are placed in the proper folder structure. Typically, you’d put them under `app/src/main/jniLibs/<ABI>/` (e.g., `jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libmylib.so`). Gradle then includes them in the APK’s `lib` directory for each architecture. If the library wasn’t in the right place or the build wasn’t configured to include it, it might not have ended up in the APK at all, leading to a runtime “library not found” error. Always verify the `.so` is present in the APK (the **APK Analyzer** in Android Studio can help confirm this ([Add C and C++ code to your project  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code#:~:text=1,to%20update%20the%20%20218))).

- **Loading the Library:** Even if the .so is packaged correctly, it doesn’t automatically run. You need to load it into your app’s process, usually by calling `System.loadLibrary("mylib")` in your Java/Kotlin code (typically in a static initializer). The name passed is the library name **without** the `lib` prefix and `.so` extension. For example, if the file is `libmylib.so`, call `System.loadLibrary("mylib")`. Failing to call this (or calling it with the wrong name) will result in an UnsatisfiedLinkError. The Android runtime will search for `libmylib.so` in the app’s native library directories and throw an error if not found or if an ABI mismatch occurs ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=please%20try%20with%20smallcase)) ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=,name%20matches%20for%20your%20library)).

- **ABI (Architecture) Mismatch:** Ensure that the library’s architecture matches the device’s architecture. For instance, on a modern phone (arm64-v8a), you must provide an arm64-v8a build of the library. If you only include armeabi-v7a (32-bit ARM), the app may fail to load it on a 64-bit device unless you set special legacy flags. As of 2021, Google Play also requires 64-bit native support for apps. So, plan to compile for **arm64** (and other relevant ABIs like x86_64 for emulator, if needed). If a required ABI is missing, the library load will fail or the app won’t install on that device. The APK in **Figure 1** above shows an example of multiple ABIs packaged in one app.

- **Assets vs. Libs:** It’s worth reiterating the difference. An **asset** file (under `assets/` in the APK) is not automatically executable and must be treated as data. A **native library** (under `lib/` in the APK) is intended to be loaded as code. In the Stack Overflow discussion, CommonsWare aptly noted: “.so files are not executables. They are libraries that you would use with the NDK.” ([java - How do you run an executable file located in the assets folder in android studio when the target SDK version is 29 or higher? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77708893/how-do-you-run-an-executable-file-located-in-the-assets-folder-in-android-studio#:~:text=%40BrentUnderwood%3A%20Last%20I%20checked%2C%20,would%20use%20with%20the%20NDK)) In other words, don’t try to exec a `.so` file; instead, load it into your app’s process via JNI.

### Why the Renamed `.so` Was “not found”  
Given the above, the likely reasons the user’s `libmylib.so` was “not found or loaded” are: 

- **Incorrect Packaging:** The .so may not have been in the correct `lib/<ABI>/` location in the APK. If you simply renamed and placed it manually, it might have been overlooked by the build system. The correct method is to put it in `jniLibs` as described or use Gradle’s `externalNativeBuild` or `jniLibs.srcDir` configuration to include prebuilt libraries ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=...%20...%20sourceSets%20,)) ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=jniLibs,)). Verify the APK actually contains the library. If not, Gradle didn’t include it. (Adding a line in app-level build.gradle like shown in the snippet – pointing sourceSets to `jniLibs` – can help if using a custom location ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=...%20...%20sourceSets%20,)).)  

- **Library Name Mismatch:** If the Go binary had an internal name or if the user called `System.loadLibrary` with the wrong string, it would fail. For example, if the library file is `libmylib.so` but one calls `loadLibrary("libmylib")` (adding `lib` again by mistake), it won’t be found. Or if the internal `soname` of the library is unusual (less common with Go’s c-shared, but worth checking), it should match. In one case, a user had `libnativeCode.so` but tried to load “native” instead of “nativeCode” ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=please%20try%20with%20smallcase)). Consistency is key.

- **Not Actually a Shared Library:** As mentioned, if the binary wasn’t built as a proper shared object, even if packaged, the system’s dynamic linker could refuse to load it. In the user’s scenario, they probably didn’t get as far as a dlopen error (it sounds like it wasn’t found at all), but if it were found and was an incompatible binary, you might see errors like “dlopen failed: wrong ELF class” or similar. The fix is to rebuild it correctly for the target ABI and as a shared library.

**Takeaway:** To use native code in your app, always compile it as a shared library for each target ABI, include those in the APK’s lib folder, and load them via Java. Next, we’ll explore how to do this with Go and with C/C++.

## Using Go on Android – `gomobile` and Bindings  
Go provides an official toolchain for mobile development via the `golang.org/x/mobile` module (often called **Go Mobile**). This includes the `gomobile` tool, which can generate bindings and binaries for Android and iOS. There are two main ways to use Go on Android:

- **Build an .APK entirely in Go** (not our case here, since we have a Java/Kotlin app).
- **Build a library to use in a Java app** – this is what we want, and it is done via `gomobile bind` (or sometimes `gomobile build` for simple scenarios).

When you run `gomobile bind -target=android`, it will produce an **AAR (Android Archive)** library package. This AAR contains: the compiled `.so` libraries for one or more ABIs, plus a generated Java API (classes) that allow your Android app to call into the Go code ([gomobile command - golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile#:~:text=The%20,ios%2C%20iossimulator%2C%20macos%2C%20maccatalyst)). In essence, `gomobile` will: compile your Go code as a shared library, wrap it in JNI bindings with automatically generated functions, and pack everything into an AAR that you can import into Android Studio. The Java/Kotlin code can then call the Go functions as if they were a normal library. For example, a Go function `func Add(a, b int) int` could become a Java class `MyGoLib` with a method `int add(int a, int b)` after binding.

This approach frees you from writing any manual JNI code – you just call the Go functions via the generated classes. It also handles packing multiple ABIs if needed.

**Issues on Windows 11 (AMD CPU):** The user encountered unspecified problems using `gomobile`. While `gomobile` is cross-platform, setting it up on Windows can be trickier than on Linux/macOS. Potential pitfalls and solutions include:

- **Android NDK Setup:** `gomobile` needs the Android NDK (Native Development Kit) to compile C components and link against the Android Bionic libc. On Windows, ensure you have installed the NDK (e.g., via Android Studio) and set the environment variable `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` (or have it in the SDK path). Run `gomobile init` after NDK is installed. If `gomobile init` fails with access errors or cannot find compilers, it indicates an NDK path issue. This is a common setup issue on Windows.

- **Go Cross-Compilation on Windows:** Go can cross-compile to Android (GOOS=android, GOARCH=arm/arm64 etc.) out of the box. The “AMD CPU” factor usually shouldn’t matter for building, because you’re not executing ARM code on the host. However, if the user tried running an Android emulator on an AMD CPU, that could be a separate headache – historically the Android emulator’s Intel HAXM accelerator only worked on Intel CPUs, though newer emulator versions use Hyper-V which supports AMD (with some performance cost). In any case, emulator issues shouldn’t affect building the AAR, but might affect testing. If emulator is a problem, testing on a physical device is a workaround.

- **Windows vs. WSL:** Some Go mobile developers report that using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) makes life easier. The build process can be done in a Linux environment even if your IDE is on Windows. As one experimenter noted, *“While building Golang on Windows is possible, there are avoidable issues, [so] use WSL as [the] build system”* ([GitHub - mrjohnsonalexander-zz/Golang-Android-WSL2: Golang native app deployed to Android device, and developed on Windows Subsystem for Linux.](https://github.com/mrjohnsonalexander-zz/Golang-Android-WSL2#:~:text=Experimentation%20with%20Enterprise%20Golang%20mobile,build%20system%20for%20this%20experiment)). In practice, you can install Go and the Android NDK in WSL Ubuntu, run `gomobile bind` there, and then copy the resulting AAR to your Windows host for use in Android Studio. This sidesteps many Windows-specific path and tooling issues.

- **Go Mobile Tool Maturity:** Ensure you have the latest version of `gomobile` (`go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile@latest`) and Go 1.16+ ([gomobile command - golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile#:~:text=%24%20go%20install%20golang,gomobile%20init)). Earlier versions had some bugs that have since been fixed. If you see errors like “binary is out of date” ([go - Error: "gomobile version unknown: binary is out of date, re-install it" - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76370744/error-gomobile-version-unknown-binary-is-out-of-date-re-install-it#:~:text=2%20%20%20%2060)) or “no NDK path set,” re-check your installation steps. The Go Mobile wiki and docs ([Go Wiki: Mobile - The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/wiki/Mobile#:~:text=You%20need%20to%20have%20Go,above%20to%20install%20mobile%20tools)) ([gomobile command - golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile#:~:text=bind%20%20%20%20,print%20version)) provide guidance.

If configured properly, `gomobile` should produce a working AAR. Include that AAR as a dependency in your app (e.g., by importing it as a module or through Gradle). The compiled .so libraries will be packaged inside the APK automatically, and you won’t manually call `System.loadLibrary` – the generated Java glue typically loads the native library for you (usually in a static block of the stub classes). You can then call your Go functions from Kotlin as if they were a normal SDK.

**Pros of Go (`gomobile` approach):** You reuse your Go code directly, avoid writing C/C++ or JNI, and benefit from Go’s memory safety and convenience. It’s great for algorithmic code or when you have existing Go libraries you want to leverage. Many have successfully used it for things like crypto libraries, game logic, etc., on Android.

**Cons / Considerations:**  
- The Go runtime will add overhead to your APK (on the order of a few MB). This includes the garbage collector, scheduler, etc. If APK size is a concern, keep this in mind.  
- Go’s runtime will run on the device and could have a performance impact (usually minor for most tasks, but not as low-level efficient as a lean C library).  
- Debugging Go on Android isn’t as straightforward as debugging Java or even C++ – you may need to rely on logs or remote debugging tools.  
- The `gomobile` project, while official, sometimes lags behind the latest Go or NDK releases. Check the GitHub issues if you encounter something unusual – often others have similar issues.

**If `gomobile` continues to be problematic on your setup**, and you want to stick with Go, another route is manually using Go’s `c-shared` mode (without the high-level bind tool). You can cross-compile your Go code to a `.so` for Android and write a small amount of JNI code to call it. This is more involved, but gives you full control. For example, you could do: 

```bash
# On a Linux or WSL shell, with NDK compilers available:
env GOOS=android GOARCH=arm64 CC=$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android21-clang \
    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libmylib.so .
```

The above would produce `libmylib.so` for arm64 (targeting API level 21). You’d repeat for other architectures (arm, x86_64, x86) by changing GOARCH and CC to the appropriate clang wrapper (and output path). This is essentially what `gomobile` does under the hood ([Running Go Code on iOS and Android](https://rogchap.com/2020/09/14/running-go-code-on-ios-and-android/#:~:text=android,v7a%2Flibfoo.so%20.%2Fcmd%2Flibfoo)) ([Running Go Code on iOS and Android](https://rogchap.com/2020/09/14/running-go-code-on-ios-and-android/#:~:text=go%20build%20,cmd%2Flibfoo)). The resulting .so comes with a C header and any exported Go functions (using a special comment syntax in Go) become C functions you can call via JNI. You would then: include these .so files in your Android Studio project (jniLibs as discussed), load them, and use JNI to call into them. This manual route is only recommended if you’re comfortable with native build tools and JNI, or if `gomobile` isn’t an option, because it requires a fair bit of setup. 

In summary, **using Go is feasible** and can be quite straightforward with the right tooling. If the user’s main hurdle was the Windows environment, switching to a Linux build or adjusting the toolchain config should solve it. Once resolved, the Go code can be used just like any other native library in the app.

## Using C/C++ with the Android NDK (JNI)  
Given the challenges above, the user is open to rewriting or using C/C++ if it proves more reliable. The Android NDK (Native Development Kit) is the official way to integrate C/C++ code into your app. This approach might be preferable if: you don’t mind (re)implementing the logic in C/C++, or if there is an existing C/C++ library for your needs (as CommonsWare hinted with the Stockfish example ([java - How do you run an executable file located in the assets folder in android studio when the target SDK version is 29 or higher? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77708893/how-do-you-run-an-executable-file-located-in-the-assets-folder-in-android-studio#:~:text=In%20this%20case%2C%20an%20asset,more%20conventionally%20using%20the%20NDK))), or if Go’s overhead is a concern.

Here’s how the NDK integration typically works:

1. **Write the native code** (or obtain a library): You can use C or C++. If porting from Go, this means translating the logic into C/C++ manually. Depending on the complexity of your Go code, this could be non-trivial, but basic logic can often be rewritten without too much trouble. If an open-source C/C++ library exists for your purpose (e.g., in the Stockfish case, it’s C++ already), you can use that. 

2. **Define a JNI interface:** The Java Native Interface (JNI) is how Java/Kotlin calls native code. You’ll write a native function in C/C++ and a corresponding declaration in Java/Kotlin. For example, in Kotlin you might declare:  
   ```kotlin
   external fun performCalculation(input: Int): Int
   init { System.loadLibrary("mynative") }
   ```  
   This means there should be a C/C++ function exported with the JNI naming convention (e.g., `Java_com_myapp_PackageName_ClassName_performCalculation(JNIEnv* env, jobject thiz, jint input)` returning a jint). Alternatively, you can use the NDK’s **JNI binding libraries** or the newer **JNI Bolt** to simplify this, but many developers still write the function signatures manually or use the `native-lib.cpp` template Android Studio provides.

3. **Compile the library with the NDK:** Android Studio can use CMake or ndk-build to compile your C/C++ sources into `.so` libraries for the targeted ABIs. The build configuration (in `CMakeLists.txt` or Android.mk) will specify the source files and the library name. For example, a CMakeLists might have:  
   ```cmake
   add_library(mynative SHARED native_code.cpp)
   find_library(log-lib log)  # NDK logging library
   target_link_libraries(mynative ${log-lib})
   ```  
   Gradle then knows to build this and package `libmynative.so` into the APK. By default, it will build for all ABIs your NDK toolchain supports unless you restrict it. The Android Gradle plugin will package the .so into `lib/<ABI>/libmynative.so` inside the APK ([Add C and C++ code to your project  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code#:~:text=1,to%20update%20the%20%20218)). Note that since Android Studio 3.6+, by default `android:extractNativeLibs="false"` is set, meaning the .so stays compressed in the APK and is memory-mapped at runtime, not extracted to the filesystem ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=,on%20Android%20M%20or%20later)). This usually isn’t a concern – the system will still find and load it. You only need to set `extractNativeLibs="true"` in the manifest if you have a specific reason (like needing to see or modify the .so file in the device file system). For normal operation, leave it as false.

4. **Load and call the native code:** As shown in the official docs, when the app runs, you call `System.loadLibrary("mynative")` to load your compiled library ([Add C and C++ code to your project  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code#:~:text=Gradle%20then%20packages%20it%20into,to%20update%20the%20%20218)). After that, any `external` functions (JNI functions) can be called. For example, calling `performCalculation(42)` in Kotlin will enter your C++ code, do the work, and return the result. The Android Developer documentation example “Hello from C++” demonstrates this end-to-end: the C++ function returns a string, and the Java code displays it ([Add C and C++ code to your project  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code#:~:text=2,to%20update%20the%20%20218)).

5. **Error handling and logging:** If the library fails to load, you’ll get an UnsatisfiedLinkError with details. Common causes were covered earlier (missing ABI, wrong name, etc.). If the library loads but something crashes, you may need to debug the native code (using tools like `ndk-gdb` or Android Studio’s debugger). You can use `__android_log_print()` from `<android/log.h>` to log from C/C++ to Logcat, which is very useful for tracing execution.

**Why NDK might be more reliable:** This is the “native” way (pun intended) of doing things on Android. Google maintains the NDK and it integrates tightly with Android Studio. There’s no extra runtime (beyond what your code needs and the small libc/libstdc++). On Windows, the NDK is well-supported via CMake. If you’re using Android Studio, the “Native C++” project template can set up a sample for you. Since the user is on Windows 11 with an AMD CPU – none of that is an issue for NDK usage. The compilation happens using cross-compilers that come with the NDK (Clang), which run on your host (x86_64 Windows) and produce ARM or x86 Android binaries. There should be no CPU-specific hiccups. (For emulator testing on AMD, Google’s newer emulator uses Microsoft’s Hyper-V backend – just ensure “Windows Hypervisor Platform” is enabled in Windows features. Alternatively, test on a device.)

**Considerations when switching to C++:**  
- You’ll need to implement or link the logic. If rewriting from Go, watch out for differences (e.g., memory management manually, using appropriate libraries for things you took for granted in Go).  
- If using an existing C++ library, you might have to write a JNI wrapper around it (to expose needed functions to Java).  
- C++ introduces the possibility of memory errors if not careful (null pointers, etc.), so there is some trade-off in safety compared to Go.  
- JNI calls have some overhead (crossing from Java to native), but it’s usually small. For computational tasks, the benefit of native speed outweighs the JNI overhead, but for very frequent tiny calls, you might design your interface to do larger batches of work per call if needed.

**When `.so` files aren’t found or loaded (NDK context):** We touched on many of these, but to cement them in an NDK scenario: Always ensure the `.so` is included for the right ABIs. If you use App Bundle (.aab) format to publish, Google Play will deliver a split APK with the appropriate native library for the device – just make sure you’ve built for all required architectures or your app might be missing a library on some devices ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=1,after%20installing%20the%20APK)) ([java - .so file not found (unsatisfiedlinkerror), but it exist - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74447804/so-file-not-found-unsatisfiedlinkerror-but-it-exist#:~:text=,folder)). Use the APK Analyzer or simply unzip the APK to verify the lib folders. If you see your lib in the APK but the app still says “not found”, double-check the `System.loadLibrary` call and naming. 

One more corner case: If your native library depends on **other native libraries**, those also need to be packaged. For example, if `libmynative.so` dynamically links against another `.so` (not common unless you have a complex native dependency), you must include that second library in the APK as well. The Android loader will try to load `libmynative.so` and fail if a dependency is missing ([loading library with dependencies - Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/android-ndk/c/J3lzK4X--bM#:~:text=loading%20library%20with%20dependencies%20,D%2Fdalvikvm)). With Go or a single self-contained .so this isn’t an issue, but with larger C/C++ projects it can be.

## Recommendations and Conclusion  
Given the analysis, here are the recommended approaches to successfully integrate and use native code in the Android app:

- **Use a Native Library (not an external exec):** Whichever language you choose (Go or C/C++), package the code as a `.so` library inside your APK. This avoids the W^X policy issue by making the code *part of* your app. You’ll load it via JNI rather than spawning a new process. This is the intended design on Android ([java - How do you run an executable file located in the assets folder in android studio when the target SDK version is 29 or higher? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77708893/how-do-you-run-an-executable-file-located-in-the-assets-folder-in-android-studio#:~:text=,within%20an%20app%27s%20APK%20file)).

- **If continuing with Go:** Try to resolve the `gomobile` issues, as it offers a high-level, convenient solution. On Windows 11, ensure the Android NDK is installed and recognized. If problems persist, consider using WSL or a Linux VM for running `gomobile bind` ([GitHub - mrjohnsonalexander-zz/Golang-Android-WSL2: Golang native app deployed to Android device, and developed on Windows Subsystem for Linux.](https://github.com/mrjohnsonalexander-zz/Golang-Android-WSL2#:~:text=Experimentation%20with%20Enterprise%20Golang%20mobile,build%20system%20for%20this%20experiment)) – you can do the Go build in that environment and then use the output on Windows. Alternatively, use Go’s `c-shared` build mode and write minimal JNI code to bridge it. Official documentation and community guides can be very helpful here (the Go Mobile wiki on Go’s website ([Go Wiki: Mobile - The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/wiki/Mobile#:~:text=The%20Go%20mobile%20subrepository%20adds,tools%20to%20build%20mobile%20applications)) ([Go Wiki: Mobile - The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/wiki/Mobile#:~:text=You%20need%20to%20have%20Go,above%20to%20install%20mobile%20tools)) is a good starting point). The key is to get a proper `lib*.so` built for Android. Once you have that, integration is similar to any C/C++ library in terms of loading and usage.

- **If switching to C/C++ (NDK):** This route is generally very reliable. Android’s tooling will handle the heavy lifting of cross-compiling and packaging. Follow the official guide for “Add C++ code to your project” ([Add C and C++ code to your project  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code#:~:text=2,to%20update%20the%20%20218)) to set up the basics. Implement the needed functionality in C/C++, expose JNI functions, and load them in your app. Test on your device to ensure it works. You’ll likely spend some time translating code or interfacing with a C++ library, but after that the runtime integration issues should disappear – the OS will happily load your library since it’s in the APK and properly signed as part of the app.

- **Debugging and Iteration:** For either approach, use logging to verify that your native code is being called and working. Catch exceptions on the Java side around the native calls to avoid crashes if something goes wrong (UnsatisfiedLinkError, etc.). If using Go, you can also log to Logcat using Android’s logging facilities (`os.Stdout`/`os.Stderr` from Go may not directly show in Logcat without redirects, so you might use `log.Println` and ensure it’s picked up, or call Android logging via JNI). For C++, use `__android_log_print`. This will help you quickly identify if, say, the library wasn’t found versus the function itself had an error.

- **Performance and Stability:** Both approaches (Go and C++) can achieve near-native performance. Go’s garbage collector could introduce pauses if you allocate a lot, but for many use cases this is negligible. C++ gives you manual control. If your native code does heavy computation, consider doing it on a background thread (from the Java side or within the native code) so as not to block the app’s UI thread.

In conclusion, **the safest bet for reliability** is to use the Android NDK with C/C++ and JNI, especially if you’re comfortable writing or generating the native code. This path aligns with Android’s default expectations and has the least number of unconventional steps. However, if maintaining the code in Go is important (e.g., you want to share code between server and app, or simply prefer Go), then investing time in the Go mobile approach is worthwhile – many developers have successfully shipped Go-based Android apps ([gomobile command - golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile#:~:text=The%20,ios%2C%20iossimulator%2C%20macos%2C%20maccatalyst)), and with the proper setup it should work. Just remember to treat the Go output as a library, not as an executable.

By following the above guidance, you should be able to package your logic correctly and invoke it from your Android app without permission issues. In summary: **embed the code as a library in your APK, load it via JNI, and the Android framework will happily allow your Java/Kotlin app to use that native functionality** ([Add C and C++ code to your project  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code#:~:text=2,to%20update%20the%20%20218)). This approach avoids the security restrictions and is the standard method for integrating native code on Android. Good luck with your implementation!
