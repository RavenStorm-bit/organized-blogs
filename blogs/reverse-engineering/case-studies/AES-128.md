# AES-128: Inside a Modern Cryptographic Fortress

## Introduction – The Unbroken Standard

In the late 1990s, the world’s best cryptographers embarked on a quest to find a successor to the aging Data Encryption Standard (DES). The result was the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) – a cipher that, over two decades later, remains a cornerstone of digital security. AES-128 (the 128-bit key variant of AES) is everywhere: it protects our online banking, secures wireless networks, and shields government secrets. It’s a cipher both elegant in its mathematical design and brutal in the confusion it imparts on data. This long-form report takes you on an immersive journey through AES-128 – from the algebraic concepts underpinning its **S-box** substitutions to the bit-level tricks that make it blazingly fast in software. We’ll explore, step by step, how a simple plaintext block is transformed through 10 rounds into ciphertext that looks like random gibberish. Along the way, we’ll unravel the key expansion strategy that derives round keys from the original key, peek at pseudocode and code snippets in multiple languages, and examine why AES-128 has withstood the onslaught of cryptanalysis. By the end, you’ll not only understand how AES-128 works, but appreciate the rigor and creativity that make it feel less like a mere algorithm and more like a well-crafted story etched in mathematics.

## Mathematical Foundations: Galois Fields and Polynomial Magic

At the heart of AES-128’s design is a bit of abstract algebra that ensures the cipher operates with a high degree of mathematical structure and security. Specifically, AES arithmetic takes place in a finite field known as **GF(2^8)** – a Galois Field with 2^8 = 256 elements. Each element of this field is an 8-bit byte, which AES interprets not simply as an integer 0–255, but as a polynomial of degree at most 7 with binary coefficients. For example, the byte value `0x57` (binary `0101 0111`) is viewed as the polynomial \(0x57 = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x^1 + x^0\). In this field, all arithmetic is done modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree 8. AES specifically uses the irreducible polynomial: 

\[ m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1, \] 

which in hexadecimal is represented by `0x11B` (since \(x^8\) corresponds to the 9-bit binary `1 0001 1011`) ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=AES%20uses%20a%20specific%20Galois,this%20means%20in%20a%20bit)) ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=Matrix%20multiplication%20is%20composed%20of,8)). This choice of modulus polynomial defines the field GF(2^8) that we’ll call *Rijndael’s field*, after AES’s original name, Rijndael.

What does all this mean in practice? It means AES does its byte-by-byte computations in a world where addition and multiplication behave a bit differently than in normal integer math:

- **Addition** in GF(2^8) is *bitwise XOR*. This is often called *carry-less addition* because, in the polynomial view, we add coefficients modulo 2 (just XOR the bits) with no carries to worry about ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=match%20at%20L221%20Addition%20in,7%20mod%202%20%3D%203)). For example, \(0x57 + 0x83\) (as field elements) is \(0xD4\) because 0x57 XOR 0x83 = 0xD4. In polynomial form, \((x^6+x^4+...)+(x^7+...)\) just XORs the coefficients.

- **Multiplication** in GF(2^8) is more complex: we multiply two polynomials and then reduce the result modulo \(m(x)\). For example, multiplying 0x57 by 0x13 in this field involves polynomial multiplication \((x^6+x^4+x^2+x+1) \times (x^4+x^1+x^0)\), then dividing by \(m(x)\) and taking the remainder (the details are tedious, but implementing it can be done with shifts and XORs). Notably, multiplication by the polynomial \(x\) (which corresponds to the byte 0x02 in hex) has a simple interpretation: it is a left bit shift followed by a conditional XOR with 0x1B (the field’s modulus trimmed to 8 bits) if the leftmost bit overflowed ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=%7B%5Cdisplaystyle%20x,8)). This trick is widely used in AES implementations for efficiency. For instance, to multiply a byte by 2 (i.e. \(x\) polynomial) you can do: `if (byte & 0x80) byte = (byte << 1) ^ 0x1B else byte = byte << 1`.

- **Inverses**: Every non-zero element in this field has a multiplicative inverse (which is part of what makes it a field). Finding the inverse means finding a polynomial \(y(x)\) such that \(a(x) * y(x) ≡ 1 mod m(x)\). In byte terms, this is some other byte `inv` such that multiplying `a` by `inv` in GF(2^8) yields 1 (the identity). For example, 0x53 has an inverse 0xCA in this field, since 0x53·0xCA ≡ 0x01 mod 0x11B. This inverse operation is **crucial** to AES’s non-linear step, as we’ll see with the S-box.

The choice of GF(2^8) with that specific irreducible polynomial was deliberate. Working with bytes (8-bit values) as field elements keeps AES efficient on 8-bit and 32-bit processors, and the arithmetic properties of this field give AES its strong *mixing* capability – small changes in input propagate in seemingly chaotic yet deterministic ways.

### Byte as Polynomial: Why this matters

By using polynomial arithmetic mod \(x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1\), AES achieves two important things. First, operations like multiplication and inversion have well-defined results within the byte-value space {0,…,255}, enabling complex transformations that are still algebraically structured. Second, the reduction modulo an irreducible polynomial ensures the arithmetic doesn’t “escape” the byte range – results always fold back into a byte. This means AES can operate on each byte in a finite, closed system, avoiding any risk of values growing beyond 8 bits. It’s like working on a clock: values wrap around, but here the “wrap-around” is defined by a polynomial instead of 12 hours. This structure sets the stage for AES’s S-box and MixColumns steps, which rely on these field operations to scramble and diffuse data in ways that are *invertible* (so decryption is possible) but *non-obvious* (so cryptanalysis is hard).

## Building the S-Box: Substitution via Inverses and Affine Transformation

The **SubBytes** step of AES – where each byte in the data is substituted for another byte – is the only non-linear operation in the cipher. Its strength comes from a carefully constructed **S-box** (substitution box) that is neither random nor simple: it’s calculated using the algebra we just discussed. Let’s unpack how the AES S-box is built and why it’s so effective.

1. **Take the multiplicative inverse in GF(2^8)**: For a given byte (call it \(b\)), interpret it as an element of our field (except 0x00 which is treated specially). Find \(b^{-1}\), its multiplicative inverse in the field. If \(b = 0x57\) (87 in decimal), we find the unique byte \(b^{-1}\) such that \(b \cdot b^{-1} = 1\) in GF(2^8). If \(b = 0x00\), which has no inverse, we define its inverse as itself (0x00 maps to 0x00 in the S-box). This inversion is known as the **Nyberg inverse** step, after cryptographer Kaisa Nyberg, and provides the S-box’s non-linear kick ([Rijndael S-box - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box#:~:text=The%20S,using%20the%20following%20affine%20transformation)).

2. **Apply an affine transformation**: The result of the inversion (call it \(a\)) is then put through an 8-bit affine transformation – basically a combination of bit shifts and XORs. In practice, AES defines this affine transform as an 8×8 matrix over GF(2) followed by a fixed addition (XOR with a constant byte 0x63) ([Rijndael S-box - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box#:~:text=mapped%20to%20itself,using%20the%20following%20%2052)) ([Rijndael S-box - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box#:~:text=Image%3A%20,16)). In simpler terms, take the 8-bit value, and transform each output bit as the XOR of a specific selection of input bits (a linear combination), then flip certain bits by XORing with `0110 0011` (that’s the 0x63). An equivalent description often cited is: take the byte \(a\), and compute \(s = a \oplus (a \lll 1) \oplus (a \lll 2) \oplus (a \lll 3) \oplus (a \lll 4) \oplus 0x63\) ([Rijndael S-box - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box#:~:text=Image%3A%20,16)), where \(\lll\) is a left bit-rotation on the 8-bit value. The result \(s\) is the S-box output for the original input byte \(b\). (For example, if \(b = 0x57\), and suppose its inverse is \(a = 0xCA\), after the affine transform we’d get \(s = 0x63\); this is just a hypothetical illustration).

The combination of “inverse in GF(2^8) then affine XOR transform” yields the 256-byte lookup table we call the AES S-box. This S-box has some crucial properties:
- **Non-linearity**: By using the field inverse (which is a non-linear operation) and then an affine mixing of bits, the S-box ensures that output bits are complicated, non-linear functions of input bits. This thwarts attackers who try to express the cipher as simple equations. In fact, the AES S-box was designed for high non-linearity to resist linear cryptanalysis ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=The%20S,16%7D%7D.%20While%20performing%20the)).
- **No fixed points**: A fixed point in an S-box would mean some byte x maps to itself (S(x)=x) or to its complement (S(x) = x ⊕ 0xFF). AES’s designers explicitly avoided those – the S-box has no byte that maps to itself, and none that maps to its bitwise inverse ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=based%20on%20simple%20algebraic%20properties%2C,affine%20transformation%20and%20then%20finding)). This prevents certain slide or involution attacks that exploit such relationships.
- **Invertibility**: The S-box is a bijection (one-to-one mapping of 0–255 to 0–255), so each output is unique. This is required because for decryption, AES needs an inverse S-box (which is actually generated by applying the inverse affine then taking the field inverse again). So, SubBytes can be undone by InvSubBytes easily – an important aspect of any secure cipher (you need to be able to decrypt exactly).

In implementation, all these calculations are typically boiled down to a precomputed table of 256 entries. The table looks random, but it’s deterministically generated by the above steps. A snippet of the AES S-box (in hex) looks like:

```
63 7c 77 7b f2 6b 6f c5 30 01 67 2b fe d7 ab 76
ca 82 c9 7d fa 59 47 f0 ad d4 a2 af 9c a4 72 c0
... (16 rows total) ...
```

Here 0x00 maps to 0x63, 0x01→0x7c, 0x02→0x77, and so on ([Rijndael S-box - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box#:~:text=60%20%20d0%20ef%20aa,0f%20b0%2054%20bb%2016)) ([Rijndael S-box - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box#:~:text=The%20S,using%20the%20following%20affine%20transformation)). These values are precisely those produced by the inverse+affine formula. For instance, 0x53 (which in ASCII is 'S') maps to 0xED according to this S-box (and indeed, `0xED` is the output of sub-byting 0x53 using the AES S-box). During encryption, AES will substitute every single byte of the state with its corresponding S-box value in the SubBytes step. During decryption, the inverse S-box (also a lookup table) is used to substitute bytes back by doing the reverse mapping ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=Finally%2C%20for%20the%20subBytes,inverse%2C%20which%20looks%20like%20this)).

The S-box is a critical component of AES’s security. By itself, it provides **confusion** – obscuring the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext in a non-linear way. But confusion alone isn’t enough; it must work hand-in-hand with diffusion (spreading out the influence of each input bit). That’s where the next steps, ShiftRows and MixColumns, come into play.

## Step-by-Step AES-128 Encryption: The Rounds Unfold

An **AES-128 encryption** takes a 128-bit plaintext block and transforms it through 10 rounds of processing into a 128-bit ciphertext. Each round applies a sequence of four operations to a 4×4 byte matrix called the **state**. Before the rounds start, the plaintext is first loaded into this 4×4 state matrix (by filling it column by column with 16 bytes of plaintext), and an initial key is added. Then the rounds begin. Here’s a high-level outline of the AES-128 round structure ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=1,three%20rows%20of%20the%20state)):

- **Initial Round (Round 0):** 
  - AddRoundKey (using the original cipher key).
- **Rounds 1 through 9 (each a full round):**
  1. SubBytes – substitute each byte via the S-box.
  2. ShiftRows – rotate the rows of the state matrix.
  3. MixColumns – mix data within each column of the state.
  4. AddRoundKey – XOR the round key for this round.
- **Final Round (Round 10):**
  1. SubBytes
  2. ShiftRows
  3. AddRoundKey (using the 10th round key).

The only difference in the final round is that **MixColumns is omitted** ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=the%20state%2C%20combining%20the%20four,AddRoundKey)). By excluding MixColumns at the end, AES ensures the encryption and decryption processes are symmetric in structure (otherwise the final round’s MixColumns would have no counterpart at the start of decryption).

Let’s walk through these steps in detail, as if following a single block through the cipher. We’ll use a running analogy: imagine the 16 bytes of the state as ingredients on a 4×4 grid cutting board. With each round, we’ll chop, substitute, shuffle, and mix these ingredients according to precise rules, and then add a secret spice (the round key) before moving to the next round.

### Initial Key Addition – Waking the State

Before any substitution or permutation happens, AES does a simple yet crucial operation: **AddRoundKey**. The 128-bit cipher key (for AES-128, that’s our main key) is XORed with the 128-bit plaintext block. This is done byte by byte, effectively combining the key with the message. In our cooking analogy, think of it as marinating the ingredients with a special sauce from the very start – without this, the round transformations alone would be predictable and reversible by anyone. By mixing in the secret key material upfront, AES ensures that from the get-go, only someone with the key could hope to reverse the changes.

Mathematically, if the plaintext block is P (16 bytes) and the key is K (16 bytes), the state after this step is \( \text{State}_0 = P \oplus K \). XOR is its own inverse, so if you XOR the same key again, you’d get back the plaintext – keep that in mind for decryption. Now the actual round transformations commence on \(\text{State}_0\). 

### SubBytes – Byte Substitution Layer

In the first step of each round (starting with round 1), AES applies the **SubBytes** operation. This is where each byte in the 4×4 state matrix is replaced with a new byte according to the S-box we discussed earlier. It’s like each ingredient on our board is swapped out for a completely different ingredient from a secret substitution pantry. A carrot might turn into a blueberry; an “A” (0x41) in plaintext might turn into 0xBC – there’s no simple pattern to it from an outsider’s perspective.

The beauty of SubBytes is that it operates *independently* on each byte, yet its non-linear effects set the stage for confusion. For example, consider a single 4×4 state matrix before SubBytes (shown in hex):

```
[19, a0, 9a, e9,
 3d, f4, c6, f8,
 e3, e2, 8d, 48,
 be, 2b, 2a, 08]
```

After SubBytes, *every byte* is substituted via the S-box, yielding a new state (for illustration purposes, result in hex might be):

```
[d4, 27, 11, ae,
  e0, bf, 98, f1,
  b8, b4, 5d, e5,
  1e, 41, 52, 30]
```

It’s hard to see any relationship between the two 16-byte sets – that’s the point. SubBytes is where AES hides the plaintext in the wilderness of seemingly random byte substitutions. Yet, because the S-box is a fixed known table, anyone who *has* the key (and thus can trace through the encryption) can reverse this by applying the inverse S-box. For the attacker without the key, however, SubBytes ensures there’s no linear correlation to exploit between input and output bits ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=The%20S,16%7D%7D.%20While%20performing%20the)).

### ShiftRows – Cyclically Shifting Rows for Diffusion

 ([image]())**Figure:** The **ShiftRows** operation cyclically rotates each row of the state matrix to the left by a certain offset (0 for the first row, 1 for the second, 2 for the third, 3 for the fourth). In this figure, the state on the left (with bytes labeled a0,0, a0,1, etc.) undergoes ShiftRows to produce the state on the right (bytes labeled a0,0, a0,1, etc. after shifting). The arrows indicate how bytes from each row are shifted to new positions in that row.

After SubBytes, each byte is individually substituted but they remain in their original positions. **ShiftRows** comes along to move them out of those positions, creating inter-column diffusion. The rule is simple: treat the state as 4 rows of 4 bytes. Leave the top row as is, rotate the second row one position to the left, the third row by two positions, and the bottom row by three positions (which is effectively one to the right, since 3 left is the same as 1 right in a row of 4). 

For example, if after SubBytes our state (in matrix form) was:

```
d4  27  11  ae  
e0  bf  98  f1  
b8  b4  5d  e5  
1e  41  52  30  
```

Applying ShiftRows:
- 1st row (index 0): `d4 27 11 ae` stays as `d4 27 11 ae` (no shift).
- 2nd row: `e0 bf 98 f1` becomes `bf 98 f1 e0` (left rotate by 1).
- 3rd row: `b8 b4 5d e5` becomes `5d e5 b8 b4` (left rotate by 2, which swaps the halves).
- 4th row: `1e 41 52 30` becomes `30 1e 41 52` (left rotate by 3, or right by 1).

The new state matrix is:

```
d4  27  11  ae  
bf  98  f1  e0  
5d  e5  b8  b4  
30  1e  41  52  
```

Notice what ShiftRows achieves: it has taken bytes that were in the same column and spread them into different columns. For instance, the first column originally was (d4, e0, b8, 1e); after ShiftRows, that column’s bytes are (d4, bf, 5d, 30). Each column now has bytes from different original columns. This ensures that the next step, MixColumns, will combine bytes that originally were in different columns, significantly increasing diffusion. If SubBytes was like changing each ingredient individually, ShiftRows is like rearranging our 4×4 cutting board so that ingredients from one column are now scattered into different columns, ready to be mixed.

This step is linear and easy to reverse (just rotate in the opposite direction). But its impact on security is profound: ShiftRows prevents columns from evolving independently of each other ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=bytes%20in%20each%20row%20by,into%20four%20independent%20block%20ciphers)). Without it, AES’s columns would function like four separate mini-ciphers – an undesirable property. With ShiftRows, a single byte change in the plaintext (say the top-left byte) will, after a few rounds, influence bytes across multiple columns and rows of the state. That’s the essence of **diffusion**.

### MixColumns – Mixing Bytes Within Columns

After ShiftRows, bytes have moved across columns, but within each column, the four bytes are still separate values. **MixColumns** mixes the four bytes of each column through linear combination over our GF(2^8) field. In the analogy, this is the step where we take the column of ingredients and toss them into a blender. The result is four new bytes per column, each one a mixture of all four original bytes from that column.

How exactly does MixColumns work? Each column is treated... ([image]())**Figure:** **MixColumns** treats each column of the state as a 4-byte vector and multiplies it by a fixed 4×4 matrix over GF(2^8) (the “⊗ c(x)” in the figure denotes this polynomial multiplication) to produce a new column. In AES, this matrix (shown conceptually on the left) is: 

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 & 1 & 1\\ 
1 & 2 & 3 & 1\\ 
1 & 1 & 2 & 3\\ 
3 & 1 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix},
\] 

meaning, for example, the top new byte \(b_{0,j} = (2 \cdot a_{0,j}) \oplus (3 \cdot a_{1,j}) \oplus (1 \cdot a_{2,j}) \oplus (1 \cdot a_{3,j})\) ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=During%20this%20operation%2C%20each%20column,of%20column%20in%20the%20state)). All multiplications and additions here are in the GF(2^8) field – so “2 · byte” is the doubling operation (shift and XOR with 0x1B if needed) and “3 · byte” is just doubling then XORing the original (since 3 = 2 + 1 in normal math, which translates to XOR in this field). By doing this for each of the four bytes in the column, we get a new column \([b_{0,j}, b_{1,j}, b_{2,j}, b_{3,j}]\). In effect, MixColumns is a diffusion layer: it blends the four bytes of each column such that each output byte is influenced by all four input bytes. A tiny change in one byte of a column will cascade to all four bytes of that column after this step. Together with ShiftRows, this ensures that after just a couple of rounds, every plaintext byte has influenced every byte of the state in a complex way ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=Both%20the%20shiftRows,the%20entirety%20of%20the%20ciphertext)).

Despite being a linear operation, MixColumns is crucial for security – it ensures the cipher has the so-called **wide trail** property: even if an attacker injects a pattern of differences, those differences spread out rapidly, forcing many S-box lookups to change in the next round (which statistically thwarts differential cryptanalysis). MixColumns is invertible too: there’s an inverse matrix (with entries 9, 11, 13, 14 in GF(2^8)) that decryptions use to undo this mixing.

### AddRoundKey – Injecting the Key Material

The final step in each round is **AddRoundKey**. This is simply XORing the current state with the 16-byte round key for that round (derived from the main key via the key schedule, which we’ll explain shortly). In round 0 we did this with the original key; in round 1–9 we do it with round1–round9 keys, and in round 10 with the final round key. AddRoundKey doesn’t involve any complicated math – it’s just combining the “secret spice” of the key with the state. Despite its simplicity, it’s the only part of the round that actually depends on the secret key, so it’s absolutely vital. Without AddRoundKey, the preceding SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns would be a fixed reversible transformation with no secrecy.

After AddRoundKey in the final round, the state matrix is output as the 16-byte ciphertext. If you were to look at the data after each round in a real AES, you’d see it get more and more random-looking. By the end of round 10, it’s virtually impossible to tell it apart from random noise for anyone who doesn’t know the key. A single AES round already scrambles data thoroughly ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=The%20result%20of%20addRoundKey,our%20example%20looks%20like%20this)); ten rounds **composed** together make AES-128 extraordinarily secure.

Before moving on, let’s summarize the flow of AES-128 encryption on a single 16-byte block:

1. **Initial Key Addition:** XOR plaintext with the 128-bit key (round key 0).
2. **Rounds 1–9:** Each round does SubBytes -> ShiftRows -> MixColumns -> AddRoundKey.
3. **Round 10:** SubBytes -> ShiftRows -> AddRoundKey (using round key 10). No MixColumns here.

That’s it – the output is ciphertext. Now, how do we undo all this? That’s where decryption comes in, which essentially runs this process backwards.

## Decryption: The Inverse Cipher

Every step of AES encryption has an inverse operation, which allows the ciphertext to be transformed back to the plaintext using the same key. AES’s decryption routine uses the **same round keys** but in reverse order, and applies inverse transformations in the opposite sequence:

- The last round key (round 10 key) is XORed with the ciphertext first (since the final encryption step was AddRoundKey with that key).
- Then it performs the inverse of the final round: **InvShiftRows** (shift rows right), **InvSubBytes** (apply the inverse S-box).
- For rounds 9 down to 1, it does: InvAddRoundKey (XOR with the round key for that round), InvMixColumns, InvShiftRows, InvSubBytes.
- Finally, after round 1’s inverse operations, it XORs the result with the initial round key (the original cipher key) to obtain the plaintext.

In practice, this means the decryption loop does the mirror image: where encryption did Sub->Shift->Mix->Add, decryption does the inverse in reverse order: Add (XOR key) -> InvMix -> InvShift -> InvSub ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=Decryption%20works%20like%20this%3A%20we,inverses%20of%20the%20various%20operations)) ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=For%20the%20shiftRows,to%20the%20left%20during%20decryption)). Let’s highlight the inverses:

- **InvShiftRows:** Instead of rotating left, we rotate each row right by 0,1,2,3 positions respectively (which undoes the left shifts).
- **InvSubBytes:** Uses the inverse S-box (each value is mapped back to its original). Remember, AES’s S-box is a bijection, so this inverse table is well-defined ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=any%20opposite%20fixed%20points%2C%20i,affine%20transformation%20and%20then%20finding)).
- **InvMixColumns:** Multiply by the inverse matrix. The matrix with constants {9,11,13,14} (in hex) is the inverse of the {2,3,1,1} matrix. This step “un-mixes” the bytes of each column.
- **AddRoundKey** is its own inverse (XORing the same key twice cancels out), so in decryption we still XOR with the round key – we just have to use the correct round’s key at the correct time (which is the reverse order of encryption keys).

One detail: the first and last rounds swap roles in decryption. Encryption’s first round consisted only of AddRoundKey, and its last round omitted MixColumns. So for decryption, the *first* step after initial AddRoundKey is **InvShiftRows+InvSubBytes** (since what was last in encryption is done first in decryption), and we omit InvMixColumns in the final decryption round. In other words, decryption starts with the key XOR and an “un-mixless” round, and ends with just a key XOR ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=One%20last%20thing%3A%20we%20need,the%20first%20round%20of%20decryption)). When implemented correctly, decryption reproduces the original plaintext exactly.

Typically, AES decryption is implemented either by computing the inverse operations on the fly *or* by precomputing a separate set of round keys tailored for decryption (for instance, some implementations compute the decryption round keys by applying MixColumns to the encryption round keys so that the same loop structure can be used). But conceptually, it’s the reverse sequence we described. The main takeaway is that AES’s structure makes encryption and decryption very similar – a deliberate choice by its designers to keep the cipher efficient both ways.

## The Key Expansion (Key Schedule) for AES-128

We’ve mentioned round keys several times – those are 128-bit keys derived from the original cipher key, one for each round (and one extra for the initial add). AES-128 uses a *key schedule* algorithm to generate 11 round keys (round0 through round10, each 16 bytes) from the initial 16-byte secret key. The design of the key schedule balances two aims: **speed** (it’s simple and fast to compute) and **diffusion** (changing one bit of the original key should cascade into many differences in the round keys) ([](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/compsec/NewLectures/Lecture8.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20XOR%20the%20bytes%20obtained,be%20used%20in%20the%20i)) ([](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/compsec/NewLectures/Lecture8.pdf#:~:text=Rcon,by%20x.%2043)).

Here’s how AES-128 key expansion works, in step form:

- The original 16-byte key is split into 4 “words” of 4 bytes each: \(W[0], W[1], W[2], W[3]\). These are also the round key 0 (for initial AddRoundKey).
- To generate the rest of the round keys, we proceed word by word until we have 44 words (which make up round keys 1–10, since 44 words = 176 bytes = 11 keys including the original).
- The core routine: to get \(W[i]\) (for i ≥ 4):
  - If \(i \mod 4 = 0\), we do a special transformation:  
    \(W[i] = W[i-4] \oplus \text{SubWord}(\text{RotWord}(W[i-1])) \oplus Rcon[i/4],\)  
    where:
    - RotWord rotates the previous word \(W[i-1]\) by 8 bits (one byte) to the left (e.g., bytes [a,b,c,d] become [b,c,d,a]).
    - SubWord applies the S-box to each of the 4 bytes of the rotated word (just like SubBytes but on a word).
    - Rcon[j] is the round constant for round j, a word with the value \([rc_j, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]\). \(rc_j\) itself is an byte value that starts at 0x01 and doubles each round in GF(2^8) (meaning \(rc_1=01, rc_2=02, rc_3=04, rc_4=08, ..., rc_{9}=1B, rc_{10}=36\) in hex) ([AES key schedule - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_key_schedule#:~:text=Values%20of%20rc_,20%2040%2080%201B%2036)) ([](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/compsec/NewLectures/Lecture8.pdf#:~:text=Rcon,by%20x.%2043)). This constant is XORed only into the first byte of the word, and it breaks certain symmetries, ensuring each round key differs in a non-linear way.
    - So we take the word from 4 positions back, XOR with the transformed previous word and Rcon. This yields \(W[i]\).
  - If \(i \mod 4 ≠ 0\), then \(W[i] = W[i-4] \oplus W[i-1]\). (Simply XOR the previous word with the word 4 earlier).

For AES-128, we will invoke that special RotWord/SubWord/Rcon transformation every 4th word (i = 4,8,12,...,40). Those give the “new injection” that diffuses the key. The Rcon values ensure each of those injections is different ([](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/compsec/NewLectures/Lecture8.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20XOR%20the%20bytes%20obtained,be%20used%20in%20the%20i)). After 44 words are generated, we have our round keys: 
- Round key 0 = words [0–3] (the original key),
- Round key 1 = words [4–7],
- …,
- Round key 10 = words [40–43].

Let’s do a quick example of one key expansion step to cement it: Suppose the last 4 bytes of round key 0 (i.e., W[3]) are (52 85 11 ae) – some hex values – and W[0] was (some bytes xx). To get W[4] (start of round key1):
- Take W[3] (last word of previous key) and RotWord: (52 85 11 ae) -> (85 11 ae 52).
- SubWord: apply S-box to each byte of (85 11 ae 52) -> say we get (...).
- XOR that with W[0] and Rcon[1] (which is 0x01 00 00 00). That yields W[4].
- Then W[5] = W[1] XOR W[4]; W[6] = W[2] XOR W[5]; W[7] = W[3] XOR W[6]. That completes round key1.

The key schedule ensures that each round key is **pseudorandom** (from an outsider’s perspective) and no two round keys are identical. Importantly, it also has the “avalanche” property: flipping one bit in the original key will completely change many bytes in subsequent round keys, especially after a few rounds. This hinders an attacker’s ability to use related keys or observe patterns. In fact, a known *related-key attack* on AES-256 exploited a weakness in the key schedule for 256-bit keys, but AES-128’s simpler schedule has stood up better – no feasible related-key attacks are known for AES-128 ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=For%20AES,2)) ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=the%20computational%20complexities%20of%202,2)).

## Implementing AES-128: From Pseudocode to Real Code

Now that we’ve dissected the algorithm, let’s talk about how one might implement AES-128. We’ll start with a high-level pseudocode for the encryption process, then look at examples in a few programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C, Go). These implementations vary in style and optimizations, but all follow the same steps we’ve described.

### High-Level Pseudocode for AES-128 Encryption

```plaintext
AES-128-Encrypt(block, key):
    roundKeys = KeyExpansion(key)         // derive round keys (array of 11 x 16-byte)
    state = LoadBlockIntoState(block)     // 16 bytes into 4x4 state matrix
    state = state XOR roundKeys[0]        // initial AddRoundKey
    for round = 1 to 9:
        state = SubBytes(state)           // substitute bytes via S-box
        state = ShiftRows(state)          // rotate rows
        state = MixColumns(state)         // mix columns
        state = state XOR roundKeys[round]// AddRoundKey
    // Final round (round = 10):
    state = SubBytes(state)
    state = ShiftRows(state)
    state = state XOR roundKeys[10]
    return StoreStateAsBlock(state)
```

This pseudocode captures the round structure. The `KeyExpansion` routine would implement the schedule we outlined, returning an array of 11 round keys (each a 4x4 byte matrix or 16-byte array). `SubBytes`, `ShiftRows`, `MixColumns` operate on the state as described, and XOR with the round key is byte-by-byte. Decryption would be analogous, applying `InvSubBytes`, `InvShiftRows`, `InvMixColumns` in reverse order with round keys 10 down to 0.

### Example Implementation in Python

In Python, a straightforward implementation might use lists of integers for state and precomputed lookup tables for the S-box and inverse S-box. Python’s clarity makes the algorithm easy to follow (though not the fastest). For illustration, here’s a simplified Python-like implementation for one round of AES (excluding key expansion for brevity):

```python
# Precomputed AES S-box (256 values)
SBOX = [..., 0x63, 0x7c, 0x77, ...]  # (actual table omitted for brevity)

def sub_bytes(state):
    # state is a list of 16 byte values
    return [SBOX[b] for b in state]

def shift_rows(state):
    # state as a 4x4 matrix flattened row by row for simplicity
    rows = [state[i*4:(i+1)*4] for i in range(4)]
    # Rotate each row i by i positions to the left
    for i in range(4):
        rows[i] = rows[i][i:] + rows[i][:i]
    return [byte for row in rows for byte in row]

def mix_columns(state):
    # Using GF(2^8) multiplication helpers for 2 and 3
    def xtime(b):  # multiply byte by 2 in GF(2^8)
        return ((b << 1) & 0xFF) ^ (0x1B if b & 0x80 else 0x00)
    def mul(b, factor):
        if factor == 1: return b
        if factor == 2: return xtime(b)
        if factor == 3: return xtime(b) ^ b
    # Mix each column
    new_state = [0]*16
    for col in range(4):
        c0 = state[col]; c1 = state[4+col]; c2 = state[8+col]; c3 = state[12+col]
        # Apply matrix [2 3 1 1]^T to this column vector [c0, c1, c2, c3]
        new_state[col]      = mul(c0,2) ^ mul(c1,3) ^ mul(c2,1) ^ mul(c3,1)
        new_state[4+col]   = mul(c0,1) ^ mul(c1,2) ^ mul(c2,3) ^ mul(c3,1)
        new_state[8+col]   = mul(c0,1) ^ mul(c1,1) ^ mul(c2,2) ^ mul(c3,3)
        new_state[12+col]  = mul(c0,3) ^ mul(c1,1) ^ mul(c2,1) ^ mul(c3,2)
    return new_state

def add_round_key(state, round_key):
    return [b ^ k for b, k in zip(state, round_key)]

# Example usage for one round (assuming round_keys already computed):
state = add_round_key(plaintext_block, round_keys[0])
for r in range(1, 10):
    state = sub_bytes(state)
    state = shift_rows(state)
    state = mix_columns(state)
    state = add_round_key(state, round_keys[r])
# final round
state = sub_bytes(state)
state = shift_rows(state)
state = add_round_key(state, round_keys[10])
ciphertext_block = state
```

This Python snippet outlines the core operations. It uses simple functions for each step. In a real implementation, you might unroll loops or use numpy for speed, but the above is conceptually clear.

### Example Implementation in JavaScript

JavaScript implementations often resemble the Python approach, using arrays of bytes. A simple (not optimized) AES encryption in JS might look like:

```javascript
const SBOX = [ /* 256-byte lookup table */ ];

function subBytes(state) {
  return state.map(byte => SBOX[byte]);
}

function shiftRows(state) {
  // state as one-dimensional array of 16 bytes
  return [
    state[0], state[5],  state[10], state[15], // Row 0 (no shift)
    state[4], state[9],  state[14], state[3],  // Row 1 (shift left 1)
    state[8], state[13], state[2],  state[7],  // Row 2 (shift left 2)
    state[12],state[1],  state[6],  state[11]  // Row 3 (shift left 3)
  ];
}

function mixColumns(state) {
  const result = new Array(16);
  for (let c = 0; c < 4; c++) {
    let i = 4*c;
    let a0 = state[i],   a1 = state[i+1], a2 = state[i+2], a3 = state[i+3];
    // multiplication helpers:
    let x2 = ((a0<<1) ^ (a0&0x80 ? 0x1B : 0)) & 0xFF;
    let x4 = ((a1<<1) ^ (a1&0x80 ? 0x1B : 0)) & 0xFF;
    let x6 = ((a2<<1) ^ (a2&0x80 ? 0x1B : 0)) & 0xFF;
    let x8 = ((a3<<1) ^ (a3&0x80 ? 0x1B : 0)) & 0xFF;
    // Note: Actually computing x2,x4,x6,x8 like this is repetitive; 
    // in optimized code you'd compute once and reuse. This is illustrative.
    result[i]   = x2 ^ (a1 ^ x4) ^ a2 ^ a3;
    result[i+1] = a0 ^ x4 ^ (a2 ^ x6) ^ a3;
    result[i+2] = a0 ^ a1 ^ x6 ^ (a3 ^ x8);
    result[i+3] = (a0 ^ x2) ^ a1 ^ a2 ^ x8;
  }
  return result;
}

function addRoundKey(state, roundKey) {
  return state.map((byte, idx) => byte ^ roundKey[idx]);
}

// To perform full AES encryption on a state:
state = addRoundKey(state, roundKeys[0]);
for (let r = 1; r < 10; r++) {
  state = subBytes(state);
  state = shiftRows(state);
  state = mixColumns(state);
  state = addRoundKey(state, roundKeys[r]);
}
state = subBytes(state);
state = shiftRows(state);
state = addRoundKey(state, roundKeys[10]);
```

This JavaScript example demonstrates similar logic. Often, real JS implementations (like in CryptoJS) use precomputed tables for combined operations to speed things up, but the above is a clear translation of the algorithm.

### Example Implementation in C

C is a common language for implementing cryptographic algorithms due to its efficiency and low-level control. A typical C implementation of AES-128 would use static lookup tables for the S-box and possibly for a combined SubBytes+ShiftRows+MixColumns operation (the so-called **T-tables** optimization). For clarity, here’s a sketch of how parts of AES might be implemented in C:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

static const uint8_t SBOX[256] = { 
  /* 256 values 0x00–0xFF in some order, starting 0x63, 0x7c, 0x77, ... */ 
};

void SubBytes(uint8_t state[16]) {
    for(int i=0; i<16; ++i) {
        state[i] = SBOX[state[i]];
    }
}

void ShiftRows(uint8_t state[16]) {
    uint8_t temp[16];
    // Row 0: indices 0,4,8,12 (no shift)
    temp[0]  = state[0];   temp[4]  = state[4];
    temp[8]  = state[8];   temp[12] = state[12];
    // Row 1: indices 1,5,9,13 (left shift by 1)
    temp[1]  = state[5];   temp[5]  = state[9];
    temp[9]  = state[13];  temp[13] = state[1];
    // Row 2: indices 2,6,10,14 (left shift by 2)
    temp[2]  = state[10];  temp[6]  = state[14];
    temp[10] = state[2];   temp[14] = state[6];
    // Row 3: indices 3,7,11,15 (left shift by 3)
    temp[3]  = state[15];  temp[7]  = state[3];
    temp[11] = state[7];   temp[15] = state[11];
    // Copy back to state
    for(int i=0; i<16; ++i) state[i] = temp[i];
}

static uint8_t xtime(uint8_t x) {
    return (uint8_t)((x << 1) ^ ((x & 0x80) ? 0x1B : 0x00));
}

void MixColumns(uint8_t state[16]) {
    for(int c=0; c<4; ++c) {
        int i = 4*c;
        uint8_t a0=state[i], a1=state[i+1], a2=state[i+2], a3=state[i+3];
        uint8_t r0 = xtime(a0) ^ (a1 ^ xtime(a1)) ^ a2 ^ a3;
        uint8_t r1 = a0 ^ xtime(a1) ^ (a2 ^ xtime(a2)) ^ a3;
        uint8_t r2 = a0 ^ a1 ^ xtime(a2) ^ (a3 ^ xtime(a3));
        uint8_t r3 = (a0 ^ xtime(a0)) ^ a1 ^ a2 ^ xtime(a3);
        state[i] = r0; state[i+1] = r1; state[i+2] = r2; state[i+3] = r3;
    }
}

void AddRoundKey(uint8_t state[16], const uint8_t roundKey[16]) {
    for(int i=0; i<16; ++i) {
        state[i] ^= roundKey[i];
    }
}

// Encryption (assuming roundKeys[0..10] are computed 16-byte arrays):
void AES128_Encrypt(uint8_t *plaintext, uint8_t *ciphertext, const uint8_t roundKeys[11][16]) {
    uint8_t state[16];
    memcpy(state, plaintext, 16);
    AddRoundKey(state, roundKeys[0]);
    for(int round=1; round<10; ++round) {
        SubBytes(state);
        ShiftRows(state);
        MixColumns(state);
        AddRoundKey(state, roundKeys[round]);
    }
    SubBytes(state);
    ShiftRows(state);
    AddRoundKey(state, roundKeys[10]);
    memcpy(ciphertext, state, 16);
}
```

In this C code, we manually implement each step. The `xtime` function does the GF(2^8) multiplication by 2. We unrolled the row shifts explicitly for clarity. An actual optimized C implementation might unroll the loop completely and use four 32-bit words to represent state columns, or use the hardware AES instructions if available. But even this straightforward implementation would produce correct AES-128 encryption given a set of round keys.

### Example Implementation in Go

Go, being a compiled language with good support for bytes and arrays, is also suitable for writing an AES implementation. The Go `crypto/aes` standard library actually provides a highly optimized implementation (using AES-NI when available), but one could implement AES-128 in pure Go as well. Here’s an illustrative snippet of what that might look like:

```go
var sBox = [256]byte{ /* ... AES S-box values ... */ }

func subBytes(state []byte) {
    for i, v := range state {
        state[i] = sBox[v]
    }
}

func shiftRows(state []byte) {
    // operate on 16-byte state in slice
    var tmp [16]byte
    copy(tmp[:], state)
    state[0]  = tmp[0];  state[4] = tmp[4];  state[8]  = tmp[8];  state[12] = tmp[12]
    state[1]  = tmp[5];  state[5] = tmp[9];  state[9]  = tmp[13]; state[13] = tmp[1]
    state[2]  = tmp[10]; state[6] = tmp[14]; state[10] = tmp[2];  state[14] = tmp[6]
    state[3]  = tmp[15]; state[7] = tmp[3];  state[11] = tmp[7];  state[15] = tmp[11]
}

func xtime(b byte) byte {
    if b&0x80 != 0 {
        return (b << 1) ^ 0x1B
    }
    return b << 1
}
func mixSingleColumn(a0, a1, a2, a3 byte) (r0, r1, r2, r3 byte) {
    // Same math as before
    r0 = xtime(a0) ^ a1 ^ xtime(a1) ^ a2 ^ a3
    r1 = a0 ^ xtime(a1) ^ a2 ^ xtime(a2) ^ a3
    r2 = a0 ^ a1 ^ xtime(a2) ^ a3 ^ xtime(a3)
    r3 = a0 ^ xtime(a0) ^ a1 ^ a2 ^ xtime(a3)
    return
}
func mixColumns(state []byte) {
    for c := 0; c < 4; c++ {
        i := 4 * c
        a0, a1, a2, a3 := state[i], state[i+1], state[i+2], state[i+3]
        r0, r1, r2, r3 := mixSingleColumn(a0, a1, a2, a3)
        state[i], state[i+1], state[i+2], state[i+3] = r0, r1, r2, r3
    }
}

func addRoundKey(state []byte, roundKey []byte) {
    for i := 0; i < 16; i++ {
        state[i] ^= roundKey[i]
    }
}

// EncryptBlock performs AES-128 encryption on a single 16-byte block
func EncryptBlock(state []byte, roundKeys [][]byte) {
    addRoundKey(state, roundKeys[0])
    for round := 1; round < 10; round++ {
        subBytes(state)
        shiftRows(state)
        mixColumns(state)
        addRoundKey(state, roundKeys[round])
    }
    subBytes(state)
    shiftRows(state)
    addRoundKey(state, roundKeys[10])
}
```

This Go snippet parallels the C code in structure. One nice thing in Go is that we can handle bytes and slices easily. The performance of this code would be decent, but could be improved by using 32-bit or 64-bit operations to manipulate whole words, or by leveraging `crypto/aes` which uses assembly optimizations.

Across these languages, the implementation differences mostly come down to syntax and available optimizations. The core algorithm remains the same sequence of operations.

## Performance Considerations: Lookup Tables vs. Bitslicing

When implementing AES-128 for high performance, especially in software, developers have to make choices about how to represent and transform the data. Two common approaches are **lookup-table-based** implementations and **bitsliced** implementations, each with its pros and cons.

- **Lookup Table (LUT) Based Implementations:** These rely on precomputed tables to combine some of the AES steps. For example, instead of computing SubBytes, ShiftRows, and part of MixColumns step-by-step, many implementations use four 256-entry tables (often called T-tables). Each table entry is 32 bits and effectively represents the result of SubBytes + ShiftRows + MixColumns for a byte in a certain column position ([Generating AES (AES-256) Lookup Tables - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15094722/generating-aes-aes-256-lookup-tables#:~:text=Generating%20AES%20%28AES,store%20these%20tables%2C%20and)). By doing 16 table lookups and XORs, an entire round (except AddRoundKey) can be done very fast using these tables. The advantage of LUT-based AES is speed on general-purpose CPUs – it uses memory trades to avoid expensive calculations. It’s also simpler to implement conceptually, as you mostly just fill and XOR registers with table values ([block cipher - What are the issues of look-up table based implementations? - Cryptography Stack Exchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/72006/what-are-the-issues-of-look-up-table-based-implementations#:~:text=The%20advantages%20are%20pretty%20clear%3A)). The downside is that large tables (1KB or 4KB) can put pressure on CPU caches ([block cipher - What are the issues of look-up table based implementations? - Cryptography Stack Exchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/72006/what-are-the-issues-of-look-up-table-based-implementations#:~:text=2)), and more concerningly, they can leak information via timing side-channels: an attacker measuring how long memory accesses take might infer which table indices (and thus which bytes of the key) are being accessed. Modern cache attacks have indeed exploited AES table lookups in some scenarios. Still, in environments where side-channel attacks are not a concern (or mitigated), table-based AES is very common due to its efficiency.

- **Bitsliced Implementations:** Bitslicing is a technique where instead of processing one block’s bits in their natural order, you process (for example) 32 or 64 blocks in parallel, each bit of a block occupying one bit position of a 32- or 64-bit register. Then you use bitwise operations (AND, XOR, etc.) to simulate the AES operations on all those blocks in parallel at the bit level. A bitsliced AES doesn’t use lookup tables at all; it computes the S-box using logical operations (which is doable by a known formula of composite field arithmetic) and the linear steps via XOR and rotates. The big advantage here is that it can be made constant-time (no secret-dependent memory access), thwarting cache timing attacks. Also, on platforms without AES hardware acceleration, bitslicing can sometimes approach the throughput of table-based implementations, especially if you have many blocks to encrypt in parallel (e.g., in a data center or on a GPU) ([Is it possible to accelerate AES bulk encryption on GPUs using ...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17520479/is-it-possible-to-accelerate-aes-bulk-encryption-on-gpus-using-bitslice-approach#:~:text=Is%20it%20possible%20to%20accelerate,than%20a%20table%20based%20approach)). However, if you’re encrypting just one block at a time on a 32-bit machine, a bitslice AES actually does a lot more work than necessary (to fill those 32 parallel bits it might need to handle 32 blocks), so it can be slower for small inputs ([[PDF] A Comprehensive Analysis of Performance and Side-Channel ...](https://schaumont.dyn.wpi.edu/schaum/pdf/papers/2010wess.pdf#:~:text=,plementation.%20We%20also)). In embedded contexts, bitslicing sometimes shines because it uses only boolean operations (XOR, AND, NOT) and no large tables, so it can be memory efficient and sometimes easier to mask against power analysis, but it might use more CPU cycles.

In summary, lookup-table implementations are usually faster on single-block operations (thanks to doing more work in parallel via table entries) but are vulnerable to cache side-channels ([block cipher - What are the issues of look-up table based implementations? - Cryptography Stack Exchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/72006/what-are-the-issues-of-look-up-table-based-implementations#:~:text=The%20disadvantages%20are%20simply%20the,attacks%20from%20a%20hardware%20perspective)). Bitsliced implementations avoid those side-channels and can use the CPU’s bit-parallelism effectively, but may require more registers and aren’t as straightforward to write. There are also hybrid approaches (recent research on *fixslicing* combines bitslicing with byte slicing to get the best of both).

Finally, modern CPUs offer a third approach: **AES instruction set extensions**. For example, Intel’s AES-NI and ARM’s Crypto Extensions provide hardware instructions that perform the entire SubBytes+ShiftRows+MixColumns (and the inverse) on a 128-bit register in one go. When using AES-NI, software can encrypt a block in just 10 such instructions (plus some overhead) – this is typically even faster than any table or bitslice method, and is resistant to software timing attacks (since the operations are constant-time in hardware). Thus, many high-performance libraries will use AES-NI if available, and fall back to a table-based or bitsliced method otherwise.

## Why AES-128 Is Considered Secure (Against Known Attacks)

Since its selection as a standard in 2001, AES-128 has been scrutinized by cryptanalysts worldwide. **As of 2025, no practical attacks against full AES-128 are known** – “practical” meaning an attack faster than brute-forcing the 128-bit key (which would take on the order of \(2^{128}\) operations, an astronomically large number). Let’s break down why AES-128 has held up so well:

- **Design Strength (Confusion and Diffusion):** AES was designed with principles from the Wide Trail strategy. Each round’s SubBytes (confusion) and MixColumns+ShiftRows (diffusion) create a snowball effect: even a small difference in input or key will, after a couple rounds, affect every byte of the state in a nonlinear way. This frustrates classical attacks like differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis, which rely on predicting how differences or linear combinations propagate. For example, the minimum number of active S-boxes in any two-round differential characteristic is high, ensuring any differential trail has very low probability. The AES S-box itself was chosen for its resistance to known attacks – it’s highly non-linear and has no simple algebraic structure that an attacker can exploit ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=The%20S,16%7D%7D.%20While%20performing%20the)).

- **No Shortcuts Known:** The best-known academic attacks on AES-128 reduce the complexity only slightly below brute force. A *biclique attack* published in 2011 can recover an AES-128 key with complexity \(2^{126.1}\) (about 4 times faster than brute force, which is \(2^{128}\)) ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=For%20AES,2)). This is a theoretical attack that still requires an unimaginable amount of time and resources – it doesn’t threaten real-world use. For AES-192 and AES-256, some related-key attacks have been found (exploiting certain patterns in their expanded keys) ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=the%20computational%20complexities%20of%202,2)), but those require the attacker to somehow get encryption under several related keys – a scenario that doesn’t apply to how AES is normally used (where the key is fixed and secret). Importantly, AES-128’s simpler key schedule has so far avoided even related-key weaknesses at full rounds.

- **Security Margin:** AES-128 uses 10 rounds, but even 8 or 9 rounds of AES-128 are not known to be breakable with feasible effort ([Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#:~:text=Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard%20,this%20attack%20is%20not)). This means AES-128 has a bit of security margin – the designers didn’t cut it to the bone. This margin helps ensure that even if a clever attack is found on 8 or 9 rounds, the full 10-round cipher could remain secure. It also means implementations can sometimes reduce rounds (for performance in special cases) and still be safe with a margin, though this isn’t typically done in practice.

- **Key Length and Brute-force:** 128-bit keys provide \(2^{128}\) possible keys (~3.4×10^38). Even with a billion-billion (10^18) tries per second, it would take on the order of 10^13 years to exhaust that – longer than the age of the universe. So exhaustive search is not a concern. The worry is always about smarter attacks that shortcut brute force – and none have emerged that come anywhere close for AES-128.

- **Public Vetting:** AES was the result of an open competition. Many eyes examined Rijndael (AES’s original form) before it was chosen, and many more have tested it since. This extensive public analysis means AES-128 has faced a trial by fire. It isn’t an obscure algorithm – any weaknesses would likely have been found by now. In cryptography, that kind of maturity counts for a lot.

In summary, AES-128’s structure and parameters have proven very resilient. It’s *not* to say AES is mathematically proven secure (very few ciphers have such proof), but its reputation is strong. As Bruce Schneier noted, “AES is the standard and will be for a long time – attack it at your peril.” Researchers will no doubt continue to chip away, especially on AES-256 which has a known related-key issue, but AES-128’s balance of simplicity and diffusion has given it an impressive defense against attack.

*(A brief aside: in the quantum era, AES-128’s security would be reduced – Grover’s algorithm can brute force in √(2^128) = 2^64 steps – but 2^64 is still enormous. For this reason, AES-256 is recommended if long-term security against quantum adversaries is a concern. But that’s beyond classical “known cryptanalysis” scope.)*

## Software Optimizations and Engineering Trade-offs

In real-world software, AES-128 implementations often employ clever optimizations to maximize throughput and minimize latency:

- **Precomputed Tables:** As mentioned, many AES implementations use precomputed tables (S-box, inverse S-box, or combined round tables). This speeds up the algorithm by replacing calculations with memory lookups. The trade-off is memory usage and potential side-channels. Some libraries offer a runtime switch: use table-based AES for performance if side-channels are not a concern (e.g., doing bulk encryption on a secure server), or use a constant-time approach if defending against timing attacks.

- **Loop Unrolling:** Removing loops in code (writing out all rounds sequentially) avoids the overhead of loop counters and branches, and can help the compiler optimize across rounds. OpenSSL’s AES, for example, has versions unrolled fully. The downside is larger code size, but modern systems can afford that for the sake of speed.

- **Instruction-Level Parallelism:** Optimized code tries to use 32-bit or 64-bit operations to handle multiple bytes at once. For instance, one can load 16 bytes of state into four 32-bit words and operate on those. XORs and rotations on 32-bit words can achieve ShiftRows and MixColumns steps faster than byte-by-byte handling. Using SIMD instructions (like SSE2 or NEON) can further process multiple state columns in parallel.

- **Hardware Acceleration:** As noted, using AES-NI or similar instructions is a huge boost. A single Intel AES-NI instruction implements one round (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns with key XOR) on a 128-bit XMM register. So an encryption can be done with 10 such instructions (+ initial/final XOR). Many programming frameworks (OpenSSL, Java’s JCE, .NET’s BCrypto, etc.) automatically use these if available. When using hardware acceleration, the difference between AES-128 and AES-256 becomes mainly just a difference in number of rounds (10 vs 14), since each round is handled in hardware.

- **Memory Access Patterns:** For side-channel resistant software (in cases where AES-NI isn’t available), implementations may use bitslicing or "fixslicing". Another trick is to use vectorized byte-shuffles (which are constant-time) to implement SubBytes and ShiftRows without cache-dependent lookups. This is slower than table lookup, but safer. It’s an example of trade-off: you might sacrifice some speed to harden against cache timing attacks.

- **Parallel Encryption:** Many libraries exploit the fact that in modes like CTR or GCM, you can encrypt multiple blocks independently. They’ll bitslice or use SIMD to encrypt, say, 4 or 8 blocks in parallel, filling 256-bit AVX registers. This improves throughput on large data. AES-NI even has a mode (on some CPUs) for pipelining multiple blocks.

The overarching theme is that there’s a spectrum from “clean, readable code” to “hand-tuned assembly”. Where an implementation falls on this spectrum depends on the goals: is this for a teaching library, an embedded device with no AES-NI, or a high-performance SSL/TLS library handling gigabits of traffic? The good news is AES-128 is flexible enough to be implemented in all these scenarios efficiently.

## High-Level vs. Low-Level (Optimized) Implementations

It’s worth noting the contrast between a **clean high-level implementation** of AES-128 and a **hardcore optimized** one. 

A high-level implementation (like our pseudocode, or a straightforward C version) prioritizes clarity. Each step of the algorithm is visible, one after the other. Such code is easier to verify and less likely to have bugs; it closely mirrors the specification. The downside is performance – it might be several times slower than an optimized version. For example, a naive C implementation might encrypt, say, 5 MB/s on a given machine, whereas an optimized one with AES-NI might do 500 MB/s or more.

An optimized implementation might unroll loops, use macro-generated code, and carefully schedule instructions to avoid CPU pipeline stalls. Reading such code can be like reading assembly – not immediately understandable. For instance, OpenSSL’s AES uses a large macro to define each round, and if AES-NI is available, it uses intrinsic functions that map to assembly. The result is fast, but if a newcomer opens the source file, they’ll see a lot of cryptic operations rather than the neat SubBytes/ShiftRows structure.

Another aspect is side-channel safety: a high-level reference implementation might inadvertently use table lookups that leak timing info, whereas a highly optimized *cryptographic* implementation might include countermeasures (like bitsliced S-box) at the cost of complexity. So “optimized” in cryptography often means not just fast, but also safe against certain attacks, which can complicate the code further.

To manage this, many libraries have multiple versions: e.g., a simple portable one and an optimized one in assembly for specific CPUs. This way, the clarity of the reference code can be retained for understanding and verification, while real-world use leverages the optimized path. For example, RFCs and standards often include a reference AES implementation in C or pseudo-code (easy to read), but products use the fast version.

In summary, the clean high-level AES code is like a well-commented recipe that anyone can follow, whereas the hardcore optimized code is like a chef’s secret technique – harder to follow, but gets the job done faster. Both produce the same result (identical ciphertext for a given input/key), which is a testament to AES’s definitiveness.

## AES-128 in Real-World Applications and Libraries

In practice, developers rarely write their own AES from scratch. Instead, they rely on widely used cryptographic libraries that have thoroughly tested and optimized implementations. AES-128 is typically exposed through high-level APIs in these libraries, often integrated into cipher modes (like AES-CBC, AES-GCM, etc., since raw AES on its own only encrypts 16-byte blocks and needs a mode for longer data and/or authentication).

Some examples:
- **OpenSSL:** Provides AES-128 through the EVP interface. You can do something like `EVP_EncryptInit_ex(..., EVP_aes_128_cbc(), ...)` to get AES-128 in CBC mode. Under the hood, OpenSSL will use an optimized AES implementation (often with AES-NI if available). The developer using OpenSSL doesn’t see the rounds or S-box – they just hand in a key and plaintext, and get ciphertext out.
- **Web Browsers (TLS):** When you visit an HTTPS site, if the cipher suite is something like AES128-GCM, the browser (or OS crypto library) is doing AES-128-GCM behind the scenes, likely via a library like BoringSSL, SChannel, or others. These libraries also use highly optimized AES, usually with platform-specific enhancements.
- **Operating System APIs:** Windows has Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) which includes AES, Linux has kernel crypto APIs and user-space like libgcrypt or libsodium. All have AES-128 available.
- **Managed languages:** Java’s `javax.crypto.Cipher` can do AES-128, Python’s `cryptography` library offers AES, Go has `crypto/aes` package. All of these are thin wrappers around a solid implementation (often written in C or assembly for speed).

One important note when using AES-128 in the real world: it’s almost always used with an *operating mode* and often with some form of padding (for block modes like CBC) or as part of an AEAD scheme (like GCM or CCM which provide authentication). So the library abstractions handle those details – you, as a developer, usually just call something like `encrypt(plaintext, key, iv)` and get a ciphertext. The library will:
  - Derive the round keys with the key schedule,
  - Perform the encryption rounds (possibly using hardware if available),
  - Maybe handle multiple blocks (if plaintext > 16 bytes) according to the mode,
  - If in an authenticated mode, compute tag etc.

Cryptographic libraries also handle things like avoiding key leakage (some zeroize keys after use in memory) and aligning with protocol specifics. 

**Security Consideration:** Because AES-128 is so common, it’s also been the subject of many side-channel attacks, particularly in software. Thus, reputable libraries incorporate fixes for known issues. As mentioned, OpenSSL had to address cache-timing attacks on AES by offering alternatives. Libsodium and NaCl use a constant-time bitsliced AES in software or just require hardware support. The average application developer doesn’t need to worry about these if they use these libraries – the hard work has been done by experts. That’s why the common advice is **“Don’t implement AES yourself, use a library”** – not only to avoid errors but also to benefit from hardening ([AES: How the Most Advanced Encryption Actually Works | by SafeHouse | CodeX | Medium](https://medium.com/codex/aes-how-the-most-advanced-encryption-actually-works-b6341c44edb9#:~:text=It%20must%20be%20stated%20that,of%20whatever%20algorithms%20you%20need)).

Finally, AES-128 is often certified (e.g., in FIPS 140-2 validated modules). This means real-world implementations go through rigorous testing (known answer tests, monte carlo tests) to ensure compliance with the standard. So when you use AES-128 from a library, you’re usually using an implementation that’s been verified against the official AES test vectors from NIST.

## Conclusion – The Immersive Strength of AES-128

From its deep mathematical roots in GF(2^8) arithmetic to its carefully layered round transformations, AES-128 exemplifies the blend of art and science in cryptography. We explored how each byte is substituted using an inverse and affine mapping, how rows are cyclically shifted to spread out diffusion, how columns are mixed with linear algebra, and how the key schedule injects the secret key in a way that echoes throughout the cipher. We also peered into code, seeing how different languages realize these steps, and how implementations balance between clarity and performance. 

AES-128 has rightfully earned its place as a workhorse encryption algorithm. It’s **accessible** – runnable on small devices and described in open literature – yet **profoundly secure**, withstanding intense scrutiny. Its design has influenced countless other ciphers and taught cryptographers invaluable lessons. For the foreseeable future, AES-128 will continue safeguarding our information. Like a well-crafted narrative, all its pieces work in concert: the algebra, the round structure, the key expansion – each chapter strengthening the plot against attackers. And as we rely on it in everyday technology, it’s reassuring to know the amount of deep thinking and worldwide analysis that back this modern cryptographic fortress.
