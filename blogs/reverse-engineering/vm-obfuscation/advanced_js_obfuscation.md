Got it. I’ll dig deep into modern JavaScript virtualization-based obfuscation techniques beyond just `VM-obfuscation`. I’ll explore how real-world tools handle complex JavaScript constructs—like async/await, closures, and built-in objects—when translating source code to a custom bytecode that still runs inside the JavaScript runtime.

I’ll also explain the conceptual and technical conflicts: how JavaScript is translated to 'bytecode' while still running inside JS itself, and what that really means in terms of execution model and limitations.

I’ll get back to you with a detailed breakdown across multiple tools and research sources.

# Advanced JavaScript Virtualization-Based Obfuscation Techniques

## Introduction to Virtualization Obfuscation in JS
JavaScript *virtualization-based obfuscation* transforms a program's code into a custom *bytecode* and executes it on a JavaScript virtual machine (VM) that is bundled with the application ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Virtualization%20obfuscation%20is%20a%20state,thereby%20executing%20the%20actual%20code)). Instead of running the original source, the browser executes a VM (written in JS) step-by-step interpreting the bytecode, never directly revealing the original logic ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Since%20the%20bytecode%20is%20executed,to%20analyze%20the%20actual%20bytecode)). This is considered one of the most robust obfuscation methods today, forcing an attacker to first reverse-engineer the bespoke VM and its instruction set before they can even begin analyzing the protected code ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Since%20the%20bytecode%20is%20executed,to%20analyze%20the%20actual%20bytecode)). Modern tools have pushed this technique far beyond early prototypes like **ajsdev/VM-obfuscation**, extending support to complex language features and larger real-world codebases.

The original source (left) is **compiled** into a custom bytecode (hexadecimal data, top-right) which is then **distributed** with a small JS VM loader. At runtime, the VM **executes** the bytecode to reproduce the program’s behavior (bottom-right) ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Virtualization%20obfuscation%20is%20a%20state,thereby%20executing%20the%20actual%20code)) ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Since%20the%20bytecode%20is%20executed,to%20analyze%20the%20actual%20bytecode)). The actual logic never appears as JavaScript source, only as interpreted instructions inside the VM.*  

## From Source Code to Custom Bytecode
**Parsing and AST Generation:** Advanced JS virtualizers typically begin by parsing the original source into an *Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)* using robust parsers (e.g. Babel or Acorn). The AST provides a structured representation of all code elements (functions, loops, expressions, etc.), enabling systematic transformation. As one research effort describes, the approach “designs and implements a virtualization protection scheme for JavaScript code based on the AST” ([Code Protection (JSJIAMI) Techniques and WebAssembly - JSVMP一键加密](https://blog.jsvmp.com/jsjiami/#:~:text=To%20address%20the%20shortcomings%20of,the%20execution%20logic%20of%20JavaScript)). This means the tool walks the AST and selects parts of the code (often the most sensitive functions) to translate into a custom instruction sequence.

**Instruction Set Design:** Next, a custom **virtual instruction set** is defined. The obfuscator will map JavaScript operations to these VM opcodes. For example, a simple VM might have opcodes like `LOAD_CONST`, `ADD`, or `CALL_FUNC`. In one open-source design, a snippet of bytecode for `var c = a + b;` appears as: `LoadNum Reg(0) 10; LoadNum Reg(1) 100; Add Reg(2) Reg(1) Reg(0)` ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=LoadNum%20Reg,c%20%3D%20a%20%2B%20b)). Here the virtual instructions use a *register-based* format (with virtual registers storing values). Other implementations use a *stack-based* model (push operands, then an opcode). Each AST node is compiled into one or more bytecode instructions. For instance, a binary `+` becomes an `ADD` opcode (after the operands have been loaded onto registers or stack). Control structures like loops and conditionals are lowered into sequences of conditional jumps, dispatch instructions, and so on, effectively flattening the original control flow into VM-level jumps.

**Handling Complex Constructs:** Modern obfuscators must model high-level JS features in terms of these low-level instructions. This often involves breaking down complex syntax into simpler operations:
- **Async/Await:** Asynchronous functions are transformed into a state-machine or handled via special opcodes. For example, an `await` can be compiled into a pair of opcodes that call the awaited promise and pause the VM until the promise resolves. In practice, this is complex because the VM’s state (instruction pointer, registers, etc.) must be preserved mid-execution. One open-source virtualizer notes that true concurrent async is not supported due to the need for “complex register management” – it opted to require that async functions in the VM run to completion or yield only at known points ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,would%20want%20to%20init%20a)). In essence, upon hitting an `await`, the VM might return a promise and suspend, then resume interpreting when the promise fulfills, restoring the register state. This allows *virtualized* async functions to work correctly, but coordinating multiple asynchronous VM threads is usually avoided ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,would%20want%20to%20init%20a)).
- **Closures and Scope:** Closures (inner functions capturing outer variables) are handled by explicitly modeling the *lexical environment*. When the AST contains an inner function that closes over variables, the virtualizer will create a runtime structure (e.g. an environment object or context array) to hold those captured variables. The outer function’s bytecode will include instructions to allocate and populate this environment, and the inner function’s bytecode will retrieve closed-over values from it instead of from the usual JS scope. For example, the tool **js-virtualizer** retains any variables that an inner function (prototype) might reference and does not garbage-collect them immediately, to ensure the closure can still access them later ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,the%20registers%20need%20to)). Advanced implementations might use reference counting or let the JavaScript garbage collector handle these environment objects once no closures reference them ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,the%20registers%20need%20to)).
- **Promises and Microtasks:** Beyond `await`, if the code uses raw Promises (e.g. `Promise.then` chains), the virtualizer typically treats them like any other object. The bytecode will include instructions to create or call methods on a Promise, which at runtime invokes the real Promise API. The key challenge is similar: if the VM yields execution until a callback, it must save state. Some obfuscators sidestep this by not virtualizing the internal logic of built-in Promise mechanics (they let the browser handle the scheduling). They ensure that any `.then()` callback that is itself sensitive is also virtualized into bytecode, which will be invoked by the VM when the time comes.
- **Symbols and Proxies:** Symbols (unique identifiers) and Proxies (metaprogramming hooks) are built-in objects that the VM typically does *not* try to re-implement. Instead, the bytecode will use instructions that call into native operations. For instance, creating a `Symbol('x')` in the original code might compile to an instruction like `CALL_GLOBAL Symbol "x"` which, when executed, invokes the real `Symbol()` function. Similarly, using a `Proxy` would result in bytecode that creates a real `Proxy` by calling the native constructor with the appropriate handler. In essence, the virtual machine can delegate such features to the underlying JS engine by invoking them as external functions. The custom VM primarily handles the *glue logic* and program flow, while leveraging the actual runtime for low-level built-ins. This means advanced obfuscators ensure their bytecode format has ways to represent calls to global objects and constructors.
- **Other Language Features:** Modern JavaScript has many features (iterators, generators, `class` syntax, spread operators, etc.). A sophisticated virtualizer must account for these in the AST->bytecode translation. Often, the strategy is to *desugar* or lower these features into simpler constructs. For example, generator functions could be transformed (at obfuscation time) into an explicit state machine (much like Babel would) which the VM can then handle as normal control flow with jump instructions. `class` declarations can be compiled into a series of instructions that define a constructor function and set up its prototype, equivalent to what the JavaScript engine does. In fact, one limitation noted in an open-source project was that direct class syntax wasn’t supported yet ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,obfuscation%20techniques)), although it’s conceptually possible to implement it by treating it as sugar. The takeaway is that the virtualization engine must either support these high-level AST nodes explicitly or pre-transform them into a combination of lower-level operations that it does support.

## Bytecode and the JavaScript VM Interpreter
Once the source is compiled into the custom bytecode, it is typically embedded into the application (often as a big array or string of hex/base64) and a *runtime interpreter* is provided to execute it. This interpreter is itself a piece of JavaScript code (often heavily obfuscated) that implements a fetch-decode-execute cycle for the custom instructions ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Virtualization%20obfuscation%20is%20a%20state,thereby%20executing%20the%20actual%20code)) ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Since%20the%20bytecode%20is%20executed,to%20analyze%20the%20actual%20bytecode)). Conceptually, it maintains a program counter (instruction pointer) and a set of virtual registers or a stack, and executes a loop like: read next opcode → switch on opcode → perform the operation (using the interpreter’s own code).

At runtime, each virtual opcode triggers some corresponding JS logic. For example, a `LOAD_CONST value` opcode might push `value` onto a VM stack (perhaps implemented as a JS array). An `ADD` opcode would pop two numbers from this stack, add them, then push the result. A `CALL func` opcode might look up a function reference and invoke it (possibly recursively entering the VM for a call to another virtualized function, or calling out to the real JS engine for external functions). The TikTok web application provides a real-world example: it shipped a large blob of “weird strings” which, upon analysis, turned out to be bytecode for a custom VM that performs tasks like device fingerprinting ([Reverse Engineering Tiktok's VM Obfuscation (Part 1) | nullpt.rs](https://www.nullpt.rs/reverse-engineering-tiktok-vm-1#:~:text=This%20is%20because%20each%20,fingerprinting%20in%20their%20own%20ways)). The interpreter read bytes, decoded opcodes and their parameters (operands), and executed the appropriate actions (like computing a canvas fingerprint) completely within this virtualized layer ([Reverse Engineering Tiktok's VM Obfuscation (Part 1) | nullpt.rs](https://www.nullpt.rs/reverse-engineering-tiktok-vm-1#:~:text=This%20is%20because%20each%20,fingerprinting%20in%20their%20own%20ways)). In TikTok’s case, the bytecode was stored as hex-encoded strings, and the interpreter logic included functions like `readOpcode()` to parse multi-byte instructions and even decrypt data embedded in the bytecode on the fly ([Reverse Engineering Tiktok's VM Obfuscation (Part 1) | nullpt.rs](https://www.nullpt.rs/reverse-engineering-tiktok-vm-1#:~:text=function%20readOpcode,)) ([Reverse Engineering Tiktok's VM Obfuscation (Part 1) | nullpt.rs](https://www.nullpt.rs/reverse-engineering-tiktok-vm-1#:~:text=let%20instructionPointer%20%3D%20stringDataLocation%3B%20const,opcodeLength%2C%20stringLength%5D%20%3D%20readOpcode%28bytecode)).

Because the bytecode is not native machine code but rather data processed by a JS program, *the performance is inherently impacted*. Each step of original logic now incurs the overhead of the VM dispatch. Open-source prototypes explicitly warn that virtualizing an entire program can slow it dramatically – one report noted an HTTP server handled ~50% of the requests of the non-virtualized version when a critical loop was virtualized ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=JSVM%20currently%20does%20not%20support,test%20it%20out%20for%20yourself)). For this reason, tools often virtualize only select functions (the most sensitive parts) to strike a balance. For instance, **aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer** requires developers to mark which functions to protect with a special comment, rather than translating everything ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=js,program%20would%20have%20to%20run)). In a commercial setting, tools likely apply profiling or user guidance to focus on hotspots that truly need this heavy protection.

Another consequence of the VM being in JavaScript is that it can itself be analyzed, so sophisticated protectors also obfuscate the interpreter. They might rename or remove obvious identifiers (like opcode names), and even virtualize parts of the interpreter with a meta-VM! This kind of *layered obfuscation* aims to make automated devirtualization exceedingly difficult ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Since%20the%20bytecode%20is%20executed,to%20analyze%20the%20actual%20bytecode)). Some techniques include *opcode remapping* (randomizing opcode values or their order for each build), inserting bogus/dead opcodes that do nothing (forcing a reverse-engineer to separate real instructions from no-ops), and encrypting portions of the bytecode or VM handler logic which are decrypted just-in-time during execution ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,done%20mostly%20by%20the%20VM)).

## Handling of Advanced Features in Practice
Ensuring that advanced language constructs work correctly on the custom VM often requires creative solutions:
- **Maintaining `this` Context:** Functions in JS have a `this` value. A virtualizer must ensure that when a method is called, the correct `this` is available inside the bytecode execution. One approach is to treat `this` as just another implicit argument/register passed into the function’s bytecode. In practice, tools adjust their call opcode to set up `this` properly, or provide a pseudo-register that always points to the current `this`. (The js-virtualizer project had this on its to-do list to implement more cleanly ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=Todo)).)
- **Built-in Objects and Methods:** The goal of virtualization is to hide *logic*, not necessarily to re-implement the entire JS standard library. So most VMs do not emulate things like `Array.prototype.sort` or DOM APIs – they call the real ones. To do this safely, the obfuscator may stash references to important built-ins (like the original `Array.sort` or `Math.random`) in its bytecode or VM, sometimes under obfuscated names. The bytecode can then invoke these via a special opcode (e.g. an opcode that means “call host function #X”). This indirection is also a chance to prevent tampering: for example, by storing a reference to the native function early, the bytecode will call that even if the environment’s function was overridden by an attacker.
- **Edge Cases and Compatibility:** Some JavaScript features (like the `with` statement or `eval`) are notoriously difficult to virtualize. Using `eval` on a string of code, for instance, would either defeat the obfuscation (if the string is plaintext) or require feeding that string back into the obfuscator’s VM (which is not generally possible at runtime). Thus, many virtualization schemes simply disallow direct `eval` of unknown strings or leave such code un-obfuscated. They might transform `eval("code")` into actual code if it’s static, or otherwise refrain from virtualization in functions that use `eval`. Similarly, `with` (which dynamically changes scope lookup) could confuse an AST-based compiler, so it is typically avoided or not supported by these tools.

## Limitations and Trade-offs of a JavaScript VM
Virtualizing code inside the JavaScript engine comes with several significant trade-offs:
- **Performance Overhead:** As discussed, the extra interpretation layer can make code run orders of magnitude slower. Every original operation (like an addition or property access) might consume dozens of JavaScript operations in the interpreter. This is especially problematic for CPU-intensive tasks. Tools mitigate this by only virtualizing the parts of code that truly need protection and leaving the rest as normal code ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=js,program%20would%20have%20to%20run)). There’s also research into improving performance by implementing the VM in faster ways – for example, compiling the custom VM to WebAssembly. One approach in 2023 implemented the interpreter in WebAssembly so that the bytecode executes closer to native speed ([Code Protection (JSJIAMI) Techniques and WebAssembly - JSVMP一键加密](https://blog.jsvmp.com/jsjiami/#:~:text=To%20address%20the%20shortcomings%20of,the%20execution%20logic%20of%20JavaScript)). The bytecode is still hidden and custom, but the heavy lifting runs in WASM, which can significantly reduce the performance penalty of the extra layer.
- **Code Size and Complexity:** The output of virtualization is often much larger than the input. Bytecode instructions are usually a binary or hex representation of what was originally a more compact high-level expression. Additionally, the interpreter code adds overhead. In some cases, the bytecode can be compressed or encoded (since it’s basically data, developers might compress it and have the VM decoder handle that at runtime). Even so, a virtualized function of 10 lines might turn into a few hundred bytes of bytecode plus the weight of the VM. This impacts load times and memory usage. Commercial tools use techniques like bytecode packing and merging of handlers to minimize the bloat.
- **Complexity of Implementation:** Supporting the full JavaScript language in a custom VM is a massive undertaking. Open-source projects often have incomplete support (e.g., lacking class syntax or full async concurrency) ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,would%20want%20to%20init%20a)) ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,obfuscation%20techniques)). Commercial tools likely leverage the work of JavaScript engines themselves by using existing parser infrastructure and possibly even embedding parts of a JS engine. Still, maintaining such a system across evolving JS standards is hard. There’s a trade-off between how much of JS to support versus perhaps falling back to normal code for unsupported constructs.
- **Debuggability and Maintainability:** Once a program is virtualized, debugging it in the browser becomes nearly impossible – the source maps (if any) would be meaningless, and a developer stepping through sees only the VM internals, not their original code. This is acceptable for a released product meant to be opaque, but it means developers must debug issues on the original code before obfuscation. Some tools offer partial debugging aids or the ability to exclude certain code from obfuscation for testing.
- **Detection and Fingerprinting:** Ironically, very heavy obfuscation can itself draw attention. For example, an extremely large hex string and a custom VM loop in a script are indicators of advanced obfuscation (in TikTok’s case, researchers quickly suspected a custom VM by the unusual code structure ([Reverse Engineering TikTok's VM Obfuscation | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34109771#:~:text=match%20at%20L1221%20Can%20I,there%20other%20comparable%20implementations))). Malware scanners and security tools might flag virtualized code as suspicious simply because benign software rarely needs such obfuscation. To mitigate this, state-of-the-art tools sometimes try to blend in: e.g., they may chunk the bytecode into smaller pieces or hide it among other data, decrypting it at runtime to avoid a telltale giant blob. They also employ *polymorphism* – changing the opcode mappings and junk instructions on each build – so that no two instances of the protected code look identical. Jscrambler, for example, advertises “polymorphic obfuscation” and even *self-defending* code that can detect tampering ([Jscrambler Pricing 2025](https://www.g2.com/products/jscrambler/pricing#:~:text=,js%20and%20Mobile)).

## Comparisons of Notable Implementations
**ajsdev/VM-obfuscation:** This was an earlier public example of a JS code virtualizer (circa 2020). It demonstrated the core idea of compiling JS into a VM, but was relatively limited in features (marked “experimental/not-done”). It laid groundwork but did not fully tackle things like async or proxies. Modern successors have gone beyond its capabilities.

**aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer:** An open-source project (2023) that significantly expanded on the concept, supporting many JavaScript features within the VM. It can handle proper scoping for variables (`let/const`), function declarations and arrow functions, `try/catch` exception handling, loops, and even basic *await* usage ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,return%20statements)) ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,for%20of%20loops)). However, as a proof-of-concept, it has limitations: it doesn’t truly allow two async functions to run concurrently inside the VM, and it warns that `var` hoisting and some class constructs aren’t supported ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=with%20the%20appropriate%20browser%20equivalents,For%20instance%2C%20an%20express)) ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,would%20want%20to%20init%20a)). Its design uses a register-based VM and requires explicit marking of functions to virtualize. Despite limitations, it illustrates how a lot of JS can be modeled in a custom VM. Notably, it discusses implementing reference counting for closures and not freeing variables until no closure needs them ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,the%20registers%20need%20to)) – showing attention to correct closure semantics. It also suggests various obfuscation tactics (shuffling opcodes, encrypting registers) that one could add on top ([GitHub - aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer: Virtualization-based obfuscation for javascript](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/js-virtualizer#:~:text=,done%20mostly%20by%20the%20VM)).

**Jscrambler (Commercial):** Jscrambler is a leading commercial solution for JavaScript protection and does include virtualization as one of its techniques. According to their feature list, “Virtual Machine-Based Obfuscation” is offered alongside things like control-flow flattening and self-defensive code ([Jscrambler Pricing 2025](https://www.g2.com/products/jscrambler/pricing#:~:text=,js%20and%20Mobile)). In practice, Jscrambler’s virtualization is likely highly polished: it supports the full spectrum of JS (as it needs to work on web apps without breaking functionality), including async code, DOM interactions, etc. The details are proprietary, but it presumably uses a combination of transformations. Jscrambler might not virtualize *everything* by default; instead, it profiles or automatically classifies the application to determine which parts to protect more heavily ([Jscrambler Pricing 2025](https://www.g2.com/products/jscrambler/pricing#:~:text=,js%20and%20Mobile)). Their marketing also highlights *polymorphic behavior*, meaning each protected build produces a semantically identical but internally different VM, making automated attacks harder. Being commercial, it also integrates anti-debugging and tamper checks within the virtualized code. For example, it could insert special opcodes that trigger if someone is stepping through the code or if the bytecode has been modified, causing the program to break or divert – these are “self-defending” measures ([Jscrambler Pricing 2025](https://www.g2.com/products/jscrambler/pricing#:~:text=,js%20and%20Mobile)) beyond what open-source tools usually do.

**Malware and Advanced Threats:** The sophistication of virtualization obfuscation has not gone unnoticed by malware authors. We see *nation-state malware* and sophisticated skimmers adopting similar techniques to hinder reverse-engineering. The TikTok case, while part of a legitimate app, shows how a custom JS VM can conceal sensitive logic (in TikTok’s case, how they generate fingerprints and signatures for network calls) ([Reverse Engineering Tiktok's VM Obfuscation (Part 1) | nullpt.rs](https://www.nullpt.rs/reverse-engineering-tiktok-vm-1#:~:text=This%20is%20because%20each%20,fingerprinting%20in%20their%20own%20ways)). There are reports of malicious web skimmers using heavily obfuscated code that behaves like a virtual machine or even literal use of tools like Jscrambler by attackers to protect their malicious scripts. In one public reverse-engineering effort, researchers had to build a custom disassembler to interpret the bytecode of TikTok’s virtual machine and noted that the company changed the bytecode format regularly to thwart analysis ([Reverse Engineering TikTok's VM Obfuscation | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34109771#:~:text=Those%20who%20care%20and%20have,tolerate%20the%20hit%20in%20cost%2Fperformance)). Likewise, malware scripts in the wild have used layered obfuscation – for instance, combining traditional obfuscators with a final virtualization layer – to defeat static analysis. Security research papers (e.g., “SoK: Automatic Deobfuscation of Virtualization-protected Applications” ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Virtualization%20obfuscation%20is%20a%20state,executed%20by%20a%20virtual))) note that each virtualization scheme defines a *bespoke instruction set*, making generic deobfuscation very difficult. This cat-and-mouse dynamic means that as these virtualization techniques become more widespread, researchers are developing new methods (like symbolic execution or IR lifting ([Writing Disassemblers for VM-based Obfuscators - Tim Blazytko](https://synthesis.to/2021/10/21/vm_based_obfuscation.html#:~:text=Writing%20Disassemblers%20for%20VM,obfuscators%20based%20on%20symbolic%20execution))) to tackle them, while obfuscator authors add even more traps and complexity in response.

## Conclusion
JavaScript virtualization-based obfuscation represents the cutting edge of code protection in the web ecosystem. By compiling high-level JS into a custom bytecode and running it on a hidden interpreter, it can obscure the intent and logic of even complex features like asynchronous calls, closures, and advanced objects. We’ve seen how modern tools parse the source into an AST and carefully model each language construct as VM instructions, ensuring that when the bytecode runs, it faithfully reproduces the original behavior – albeit much slower and in a form that’s extremely difficult to analyze. This approach does come with significant trade-offs in performance and implementation complexity, but for protecting critical code (such as licensing checks, algorithmic secrets, or security logic), the obfuscation strength often outweighs the costs. 

In practice, developers and commercial providers mitigate the downsides through selective use (only virtualizing what’s truly necessary), optimizations like using WebAssembly interpreters, and augmenting the VM with other obfuscation layers. The landscape continues to evolve: as attackers improve at cracking these virtual machines, new variants (with more exotic instruction sets, dynamic opcode encryption, or even AI-generated instruction shuffles) are emerging. Likewise, both malware authors and legitimate software are adopting these techniques, making it an area of active arms race in JavaScript security. By comparing open-source projects, enterprise tools like Jscrambler, and real-world obfuscated malware, one gains an appreciation of both the power and the challenges of translating JavaScript into its own virtual language. The concept is intellectually akin to building a “JS inside JS” – a lower-level machine that the attacker doesn’t understand – and as our survey shows, when done carefully, it can significantly raise the bar for reverse-engineering JavaScript code ([The Secret Guide To Virtualization Obfuscation In JavaScript | Johannes Willbold](https://jwillbold.com/posts/obfuscation/2019-06-16-The-Secret-Guide-To-Virtualization-Obfuscation-In-JavaScript/#:~:text=Since%20the%20bytecode%20is%20executed,to%20analyze%20the%20actual%20bytecode)) ([Jscrambler Pricing 2025](https://www.g2.com/products/jscrambler/pricing#:~:text=,js%20and%20Mobile)).
