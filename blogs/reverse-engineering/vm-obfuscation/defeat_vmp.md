# Reverse Engineering VMProtect: Virtualization, Anti-Debugging, and Obfuscation

## Virtualization (VM Layer Analysis)

VMProtect’s hallmark is its **code virtualization** – original machine code is translated into a custom bytecode that a built-in virtual machine (VM) executes. Researchers have found that VMProtect implements a **RISC-style stack-based VM** with a unique instruction set for each protected binary ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=Virtual%20instructions%20are%20decrypted%20and,with%20the%20decrypted%20operand%20value)). For example, analysis by *CKCat* (Back Engineering blog) on VMProtect 2 revealed specific register roles: the VM uses the native register RSI as a **virtual instruction pointer (VIP)** and RBP/R10 as a **virtual stack pointer (VSP) ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=To%20begin%2C%20RSI%20is%20always,RSI%20is%20done%20by%20vm_entry)) ([VMProtect 3: Virtualization-Based Software Obfuscation Pt. 2](https://www.mitchellzakocs.com/blog/vmprotect3#:~:text=Virtual%20Stack)).** An initial encrypted pointer to the bytecode is pushed on the stack and decrypted via a sequence of arithmetic transformations, yielding the start of the virtual instruction stream ([VMProtect 3: Virtualization-Based Software Obfuscation Pt. 2](https://www.mitchellzakocs.com/blog/vmprotect3#:~:text=After%20the%20registers%20are%20pushed%2C,at%20the%20moment%2C%20it%20does)). A **rolling decryption key** is then used to decrypt each bytecode instruction and its operands on the fly ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=machine%20with%20scratch%20registers,with%20the%20decrypted%20operand%20value)) ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=RBX%20is%20a%20very%20special,with%20the%20decrypted%20operand%E2%80%99s%20value)). This rolling key (held in a register like RBX or R9) is updated after every instruction (e.g. XOR/ADD with the last decoded operand), meaning if execution jumps to the wrong bytecode address or out-of-order, decryption fails ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=VMProtect%202%20uses%20a%20rolling,virtual%20operands%20to%20be%20invalid)) ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=RBX%20is%20a%20very%20special,with%20the%20decrypted%20operand%E2%80%99s%20value)). This design thwarts trivial dumping or hooking of bytecode since the correct execution flow is needed to maintain the decryption key’s state.

Reversing this virtualization layer is extremely challenging. Each protected function’s bytecode and handler logic are **obfuscated and unique per compile** ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=Virtual%20instructions%20are%20decrypted%20and,with%20the%20decrypted%20operand%20value)), so analysts often must reverse-engineer the VM for each target. One approach is **static analysis** of the VM internals: identifying the VM dispatcher and handler table in the native code and then decoding each virtual opcode’s semantics. For instance, *can1357* (author of the “NoVmp” devirtualizer) documented how VMProtect 3’s paid version uses no obvious switch-case dispatcher at all – instead relying on the rolling key and pointer arithmetic to determine the next handler, unlike the simpler demo version which had a normal switch-based VM without encrypted opcodes ([  Quick look around VMP 3.x - Part 3 : Virtualization | r0da's Blog](https://whereisr0da.github.io/blog/posts/2021-02-16-vmp-3/#:~:text=Demo%20version%20is%20not%20even,x%20%28handle)). Static reverse-engineering involves peeling away junk code and encryption to recover handler functions. Common VM instructions that have been documented include stack operations (e.g. pushing/popping constants or registers), arithmetic (ADD, MUL, DIV, etc.), and control flow instructions (virtual jumps, calls, conditional branches), all implemented as native “**VM handlers**” that simulate the original code’s effect ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=match%20at%20L201%20,the%20opcode%20for%20the%20instruction)) ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=,rax)). The Back Engineering write-up by *CKCat* even enumerated dozens of these handler opcodes (e.g. `LCONST` to load constants, `LREG/SREG` to move values between virtual and native registers, arithmetic like `ADDQ`, bit operations, etc.) and described their behavior ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=%2A%20LCONSTCBW%20,Scratch%20Register%20Value%20Onto%20Stack)) ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=match%20at%20L131%20,Case%20study%3A%20string%20algorithm)).

On the other hand, **dynamic analysis** techniques have proven fruitful, especially for recovering the logic of *specific* virtualized functions. Security researcher *Jonathan Salwan* took a **symbolic execution** approach: he treats the VM as a black-box and records a trace of its execution, then symbolically separates the *actual original program’s behavior* from the VM’s internal mechanics ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=The%20approach)). In his *VMProtect-Devirtualization* project, Salwan outlines a step-by-step dynamic deobfuscation: 

1. **Identify the virtualized function** and its inputs (e.g. by spotting the `VMProtectBegin` marker or the jump into a `.vmp` section).  
2. **Execute the protected code to collect a trace** of all instructions run by the VM for a given input. This can be done with an instrumentation engine or emulator that logs each executed instruction (Salwan used a custom “x64unpack” emulator to capture the trace ([Unveiling the VMProtect-devirtualization Project: A Review that project | by Gonchik Tsymzhitov | Medium](https://gonchik.medium.com/unveiling-the-vmprotect-devirtualization-project-a-review-that-project-4ecb55796200#:~:text=In%20this%20review%2C%20I%20explore,vulnerabilities%20in%20protected%20game%20software))).  
3. **Replay and symbolically evaluate the trace**: using a solver, determine which operations correspond to the original function’s semantics vs. which are VM overhead. Essentially, as one report describes, the trace `T'` consists of the original instructions `T` intertwined with VM handler logic `VM(T)`. If one can distinguish these, it’s possible to rebuild the original code path ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=The%20approach)).  
4. **Optimize and remove VM-specific operations** from the symbolic expression. By simplifying the equations (e.g. removing the effects of the rolling key decryption and stack manipulations that don’t affect final outputs), the underlying algorithm is revealed ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=We%20rely%20on%20the%20key,case%20in%20many%20situations%20involving)) ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=%5B00%5D%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Flegacy%2Fevent%2Fwoot09%2Ftech%2Ffull_papers%2Frolles.pdf%20%5B01%5D%20https%3A%2F%2Fsecret.club%2F2021%2F09%2F08%2Fvmprotect,stack%2FVMUnprotect)).  
5. **Lift the simplified logic to a higher-level representation** (Salwan uses LLVM IR) and recompile it to verify the devirtualized function behaves like the original ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=1,unprotected%20version%20of%20the%20target)). 

Using this method, Salwan was able to automatically recover pure arithmetic routines that had been virtualized by VMProtect ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=I%20am%20sharing%20some%20notes,fully%20devirtualize%20small%20functions%20dynamically)) ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=The%20approach)). Another extensive series by *Matteo Memelli (fvrmatteo)* titled **“Tickling VMProtect with LLVM”** (Secret Club, 2021) also demonstrates an LLVM-based devirtualization pipeline. In Part 1 of that series, Matteo describes lifting the VM’s execution into an IR, implementing the **semantics of key VM handlers in LLVM** (e.g., stack push, arithmetic operations) so that the VM bytecode can be translated into an LLVM module ([Tickling VMProtect with LLVM: Part 1 | secret club](https://secret.club/2021/09/08/vmprotect-llvm-lifting-1.html#:~:text=Semantics%20of%20the%20handlers)) ([Tickling VMProtect with LLVM: Part 1 | secret club](https://secret.club/2021/09/08/vmprotect-llvm-lifting-1.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L772%20template%20handlers,IR%20level)). Part 2 explores automatic path exploration of the virtualized control flow using SMT solving, and Part 3 applies LLVM optimizations to clean up the lifted code ([Tickling VMProtect with LLVM: Part 1 - secret club](https://secret.club/2021/09/08/vmprotect-llvm-lifting-1.html#:~:text=This%20series%20of%20posts%20delves,around%20with%20LLVM%20and%20VMProtect)) ([Tickling VMProtect with LLVM: Part 2 - secret club](https://secret.club/2021/09/08/vmprotect-llvm-lifting-2.html#:~:text=Tickling%20VMProtect%20with%20LLVM%3A%20Part,to%20explore%20the%20virtualized%20CFG)). These modern techniques treat the VM as just another “machine” to be emulated and optimized against, albeit with significant complexity.

Regardless of approach, researchers emphasize the **sheer difficulty and engineering effort** required. Each new VMProtect version adds layers of obfuscation to the VM handlers and dispatch logic. For example, VMProtect 3.x introduced “ultra” mode options that randomize handler ordering, insert bogus handlers, or even swap the roles of VIP and VSP registers to confuse pattern-matching ([  Quick look around VMP 3.x - Part 3 : Virtualization | r0da's Blog](https://whereisr0da.github.io/blog/posts/2021-02-16-vmp-3/#:~:text=%2A%20VIII.1%20,Ultra%20mode)) ([  Quick look around VMP 3.x - Part 3 : Virtualization | r0da's Blog](https://whereisr0da.github.io/blog/posts/2021-02-16-vmp-3/#:~:text=%2A%20VIII.1.2%20,MBA)). Mixed Boolean Arithmetic (MBA) may be used inside handlers (e.g. replacing simple arithmetic with complex algebraic equivalents) to thwart understanding ([  Quick look around VMP 3.x - Part 3 : Virtualization | r0da's Blog](https://whereisr0da.github.io/blog/posts/2021-02-16-vmp-3/#:~:text=%2A%20VIII.2%20,Ultra%20mode)). The end result is that unpacking the virtualization **“is not that it can’t be done, but the effort required outweighs the benefit in most cases” ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=Image%3A%20What%20the%20hell%20is,9GAG)).** As one reverse engineer quipped, VMProtect’s virtualization can make analysts “suddenly not want to reverse engineer the product anymore” ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=Image%3A%20What%20the%20hell%20is,9GAG)). In practice, reverse-engineers often target only *specific* critical functions (like license checks or cryptographic routines protected by the VM) for devirtualization, rather than try to rebuild an entire program.

## Anti-Debugging Features in VMProtect

Aside from virtualization, VMProtect packs in extensive **anti-debugging and anti-VM** tricks to frustrate reverse engineering. In a 2023 analysis, *Hendrik Eckardt* detailed how a VMProtect 3.6-protected malware (SystemBC) checks for debuggers and sandboxes at runtime ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=A%20colleague%20of%20mine%20recently,out%20what%20is%20going%20on)). Many of the anti-debug checks are fairly standard: VMProtect will inspect the Process Environment Block flags and other Windows indicators to see if a debugger is present ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=On%20the%20face%20of%20it%2C,long%20since%20had%20support%20for)). Among the observed checks were:

- **PEB.BeingDebugged flag** – simple Boolean in the process memory indicating a debugger.  
- **Check for a Debugger Port or Object** – calling `NtQueryInformationProcess` for `ProcessDebugPort` or `ProcessDebugObjectHandle` ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=On%20the%20face%20of%20it%2C,long%20since%20had%20support%20for)).  
- **`NtSetInformationThread(ThreadHideFromDebugger)`** – attempting to hide threads from debugger control ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=,CloseHandle%20with%20invalid%20handle%20value)).  
- **Exception-based checks** – e.g. using `CloseHandle(INVALID_HANDLE)` to trigger an exception and then inspecting the CPU context’s debug registers (non-zero values indicate a hardware breakpoint set) ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=,in%20CONTEXT%20when%20catching%20exceptions)).

All of the above are well-known anti-debug tricks (Checkpoint Research maintains an excellent catalog of these ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=On%20the%20face%20of%20it%2C,long%20since%20had%20support%20for))), and tools like ScyllaHide typically neutralize them. However, VMProtect layers on **more exotic techniques**. One such trick is the use of **“Heaven’s Gate”** on 32-bit processes ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=64,bit%20system%20for%20this%20sample)). Here, the protector deliberately performs a far jump from 32-bit code into a 64-bit code segment (selector `0x33` on Windows), effectively switching the CPU to 64-bit mode inside a 32-bit process. This confounds most user-mode debuggers (e.g. x64dbg) which can only debug one mode at a time – the 32-bit debugger cannot follow into the 64-bit code ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=64,bit%20system%20for%20this%20sample)). In Eckardt’s case, this forced the analysts to either switch to a 64-bit capable debugger (they note WinDbg can handle mixed-mode but is cumbersome ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=Gate%20www,bit%20system%20for%20this%20sample))) or to run the sample on a purely 32-bit OS to keep execution in one mode.

Another advanced anti-debug measure is **syscall obfuscation**. VMProtect has a built-in table of raw system call numbers for various Windows versions ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=The%20next%20problem%20is%20that,call%20the%20APIs%20the%20regular)). When performing anti-debug and anti-VM checks, it prefers to invoke system calls directly (via the `sysenter` or `syscall` instruction) instead of calling WinAPI functions. This bypasses user-mode API hooks (like those that ScyllaHide sets) because it never calls into the hooked API – it jumps straight into kernel mode ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=The%20next%20problem%20is%20that,call%20the%20APIs%20the%20regular)). On a known Windows build (e.g. Windows 10 with a specific build number), VMProtect can obtain the service ID for `NtSetInformationThread` or other syscalls and execute it directly. Eckardt’s team discovered a clever way to counter this: **fool the program into thinking it’s on an unrecognized OS** so that it falls back to normal API calls. They achieved this by patching the Windows version fields (e.g. in the PEB or KUSER_SHARED_DATA) to fake an unknown build number, causing VMProtect to give up on the direct syscalls and use ordinary function calls that their hooks can catch ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=If%20you%20thought%20we%E2%80%99re%20finally,the%20regular%20NTDLL%20API%20export)) ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=hooks%20and%20other%20code%20patches,the%20regular%20NTDLL%20API%20export)). In cases where VMProtect tries to be even sneakier – for example, by mapping a fresh copy of Ntdll.dll and scanning it for the expected `mov eax, <syscall#>` instruction bytes to discover syscalls ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=from%20the%20library%20code,the%20regular%20NTDLL%20API%20export)) – the analysts preempted it by corrupting those bytes in the loaded image. When VMProtect failed to find the signature for the syscall stub, it again resorted to the normal path ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=hooks%20and%20other%20code%20patches,the%20regular%20NTDLL%20API%20export)).

**Virtual machine detection** tricks are also present. Modern malware often checks if it’s running in a virtualized environment (like VirtualBox, VMware) to evade analysis. VMProtect assists in this by performing things like: `CPUID` with hypervisor flags, checking for known virtual device names or driver DLLs (e.g. `sbiedll.dll` for Sandboxie) ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=,in%20process%2C%20for%20Sandboxie%20detection)), and even using timing checks. One particularly cunning trick noted by Eckardt involves abusing the CPU **Trap Flag**. VMProtect sets the processor’s single-step flag and then executes a CPUID instruction followed by a no-op, expecting to receive a single-step exception at the no-op. In certain older hypervisors (VirtualBox < 7.0.4), a bug caused the trap to be delayed one instruction further than expected, so the exception report showed the CPU at a later instruction than on real hardware ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=The%20Trap%20Flag%20provides%20single,at%20the%20time%20of%20writing)). By comparing the instruction pointer, the protector can deduce if it’s in a VM (where the bug triggers) or on real hardware ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=The%20Trap%20Flag%20provides%20single,at%20the%20time%20of%20writing)). This kind of **timing and CPU behavior check** is quite low-level and had the analysts stumped for a while until they identified it. The solution in that case was simply to update the VM software (VirtualBox fixed the bug) or avoid that VM platform. VMProtect also queries system firmware tables (ACPI/SMBIOS) via `NtQuerySystemInformation` to look for telltale strings like “VBox” in BIOS data ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=Finally%2C%20VMProtect%20will%20inspect%20some,cannot%20be%20helped%20without%20modifying)). To counter this, the researchers extended ScyllaHide to hook that API call and blank out suspicious entries ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=Finally%2C%20VMProtect%20will%20inspect%20some,cannot%20be%20helped%20without%20modifying)) ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=What%20we%20can%20do%20is,class)).

**Summary of defenses:** The analysts had to deploy a combination of tools to defeat these countermeasures: *ScyllaHide* for routine anti-debug API hooks, *custom hooks/patches* for the syscalls and OS checks, running in a *controlled environment* (a real 32-bit OS in this case), and even *kernel-level strategies* (they mention tools like TitanHide/HyperHide could have handled many checks by operating outside the program’s context ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=Kernel%20mode%20tooling%20such%20as,use%20and%20easier%20to%20debug))). It’s a cat-and-mouse game – VMProtect continuously evolves new ways to detect debuggers or VMs, and reversers respond with new patches or environments to neutralize them. Hendrik Eckardt’s write-up showcases the iterative nature of this process: **each anti-debug trick was uncovered and answered with a specific workaround** until finally the code could be debugged normally ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=Conclusion)).

*(Author’s note: Many of these anti-debug tricks are not unique to VMProtect – other packers and malware use them as well – but VMProtect’s strength is combining them with the tangled virtualization logic. This means a reverse-engineer might first need to **disable dozens of booby traps** just to reach the point of analyzing the virtualized code!)*

## Control Flow Obfuscation Mechanisms

Beyond virtualization, VMProtect applies classic **control-flow obfuscation** to make its code (and any non-virtualized parts of the target program) difficult to analyze. A prominent technique used is **control flow flattening**. As explained by *Katy Hearthstone* in a case study ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=The%20key%20idea%20is%20that,which%20block%20will%20execute%20next)) ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=We%20can%20flatten%20this%20code,statement%20as%20follows)), flattening takes all the basic blocks of a function and merges them into a single mega-block governed by a **state variable**. Instead of the program executing sequentially or via normal loops and branches, it enters a dispatcher loop (often a `while(true)` or similar) that uses a big `switch` or a series of nested `if` statements. Each original block becomes one `case` in the switch (or one branch in the if cascade), and at the end of executing a block, the code sets the state variable to indicate the next block’s label. This transforms a clear, structured flow of control into a swamp of seemingly arbitrary jumps. The control flow graph (CFG) of the function becomes essentially one node (the dispatcher loop) that cycles to itself, losing all obvious structure ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=The%20control%20flow%20graph%20,original%20function%20looks%20like%20this)) ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=Obviously%20this%20is%20a%20simple,another%20state%20and%20so%20on)). VMProtect’s implementation of flattening uses large random integers for state values (instead of neat sequential cases) and scatters the cases in non-linear order ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=Obviously%20this%20is%20a%20simple,another%20state%20and%20so%20on)). It also inserts **opaque predicates** – conditional checks that are always true/false but not apparent to static analysis – to drive the state transitions, and it may include **dead code cases** (states that never occur in reality) to mislead analysts ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=Obviously%20this%20is%20a%20simple,another%20state%20and%20so%20on)). The result is what Katy humorously describes as “making software analysts vomit on their Herman Millers” due to the absurd complexity ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20control%20flow,expensive%20chairs%20is%20in%20peril)) ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=Image%3A%20What%20the%20hell%20is,9GAG)). In her example, a flattened string decryption function ballooned to ~2000 lines of decompiled pseudocode and an extremely convoluted graph ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=string%20decryption%20code%20that%20was,for%20cryptanalysis%20without%20reverse%20engineering)).

Other control-flow tricks in VMProtect include **opaque branching and jump obfuscation** outside of full flattening. *Mitch Zakocs* observes that even with virtualization enabled alone, VMProtect 3 inserts lots of **bogus jumps** and **push+ret sequences** in the native code to break disassemblers’ assumptions ([VMProtect 3: Virtualization-Based Software Obfuscation Pt. 2](https://www.mitchellzakocs.com/blog/vmprotect3#:~:text=Another%20annoying%20static%20obfuscation%20that,are%20fairly%20difficult%20to%20remove)). These appear as jump instructions that go to unpredictable locations or a `push` of an address followed by a `ret` (a form of indirection) to confuse static analysis. He notes that opaque conditional jumps—tiny `if` fragments that always go one way—are peppered throughout, creating **spaghetti code** and cluttering IDA’s graph view ([VMProtect 3: Virtualization-Based Software Obfuscation Pt. 2](https://www.mitchellzakocs.com/blog/vmprotect3#:~:text=Another%20annoying%20static%20obfuscation%20that,are%20fairly%20difficult%20to%20remove)). Additionally, VMProtect performs **code mutation** (when enabled) which can include substituting code sequences with different but equivalent ones, and **code blending/duplication** where multiple copies or interleaved pieces of code appear. All these make it **non-trivial to distinguish real logic from decoys**.

Reverse-engineers tackle control-flow obfuscation through a combination of manual and automated means. A common first step is to simplify the obfuscated function by removing obviously dead code and NOPs. For instance, Zakocs wrote an IDA plugin to automatically nop out the “dead store” instructions that VMProtect inserts (stores to stack or registers that are never used) ([VMProtect 3: Virtualization-Based Software Obfuscation Pt. 2](https://www.mitchellzakocs.com/blog/vmprotect3#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20obnoxious,to%20eliminate%20dead%20store%20code)). This cleanup can slightly declutter the view. The harder task is dealing with flattening. One manual approach (as used by Katy Hearthstone) is **restructuring the flattened code by following the state variable**. By observing how the state value changes and which code corresponds to which state, an analyst can map out the original sequence of blocks. In Katy’s write-up, she gradually identified the meaning of each state in the switch by understanding the function’s purpose (string decryption) and watching how the variables changed for a given input ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=,I)). In some cases, if you can execute the code, you might log the state transitions to recover the genuine order of execution. There are also academic approaches where one could model the state machine and attempt to **automatically reconstruct the CFG** by treating each state as a node and each state assignment as an edge. Indeed, tools exist in the research community for deobfuscating flattened control flow, though they may need adaptation for VMProtect’s flavor of it.

Another challenge is the **mixed real and fake control flow**. VMProtect might integrate its virtualization with control-flow obfuscation, meaning some flattened constructs may direct into or out of virtualized code. *R0da’s Blog* notes that in some Ultra mode scenarios, even the VM’s internal control flow (the virtual branch handlers) can be further obfuscated or combined with junk “calls” to fake routines ([  Quick look around VMP 3.x - Part 3 : Virtualization | r0da's Blog](https://whereisr0da.github.io/blog/posts/2021-02-16-vmp-3/#:~:text=%2A%20VIII.2%20,Ultra%20mode)) ([  Quick look around VMP 3.x - Part 3 : Virtualization | r0da's Blog](https://whereisr0da.github.io/blog/posts/2021-02-16-vmp-3/#:~:text=%2A%20VIII.2.2%20,Ultra%20mode)). This demands the reverser carefully separate which obfuscation layer they are dealing with at each point (is it a virtual jump in bytecode or a real opaque jump in native code?). In practice, experts often use **dynamic execution** to simplify this: by running the protected code (under debugging or emulation) and monitoring it, they can bypass opaque conditions (since at runtime each opaque predicate chooses a path definitively) and dump the *real* executed code path. However, dumping a single path still leaves the question of understanding alternative paths.

In summary, **control flow obfuscation in VMProtect aims to frustrate static analysis**. It doesn’t change what the code *does*, but it makes the how very convoluted. Reversers respond by **iteratively cleaning and isolating the core logic**. They remove junk, resolve opaque predicates (often by evaluating the conditions or using SMT solvers), and re-link the jumbled code into a sensible order. While time-consuming, these efforts can recover algorithms hidden under thousands of lines of “spaghetti.” The key is often recognizing patterns (for example, a big switch on a `state` variable is a giveaway of flattening ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=The%20key%20idea%20is%20that,which%20block%20will%20execute%20next)) ([Reverse Engineering Adventures: VMProtect Control Flow Obfuscation (Case study: string algorithm cryptanalysis in Honkai Impact 3rd) | Katy's Code](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/reverse-engineering-adventures-vmprotect-control-flow-obfuscation-case-study-string-algorithm-cryptanalysis-in-honkai-impact-3rd/#:~:text=We%20can%20flatten%20this%20code,statement%20as%20follows))) and then applying a mix of static analysis and execution tracing to invert the transformation.

## Tools and Techniques Used by Researchers

Reverse-engineering VMProtect typically requires a **suite of specialized tools and custom techniques**, given the protector’s complexity. Here we outline some of the notable tools and methods mentioned across various write-ups, along with the researchers who employed them:

- **IDA Pro and Ghidra for Static Analysis:** These disassemblers are the starting point to inspect VMProtect-protected binaries. Analysts often write custom IDA Python scripts or plugins to assist. For example, Mitch Zakocs created an IDA plugin “NOPnHIDE” to automatically remove dead-store obfuscation in VMProtect routines ([VMProtect 3: Virtualization-Based Software Obfuscation Pt. 2](https://www.mitchellzakocs.com/blog/vmprotect3#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20obnoxious,to%20eliminate%20dead%20store%20code)). Others use pattern matching scripts to locate the VM dispatcher or known prologue/epilogue byte patterns of VM handlers. However, static analysis alone is difficult due to the heavy obfuscation and encrypted bytecode.

- **Dynamic Unpacking and Emulation:** Since VMProtect also packs and encrypts the code, one often needs to *unpack* the program in memory. Tools like x64dbg or WinDbg are used to break at the OEP (Original Entry Point) after the VMProtect loader has unpacked the binary. *R0da’s blog* (2021) details using Windows debugging APIs to catch when `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` is called to change memory protections (a sign the unpacker is about to write the real code) ([ Quick look around VMP 3.x - Part 1 : Unpacking | r0da's Blog](https://whereisr0da.github.io/blog/posts/2021-01-05-vmp-1/#:~:text=As%20we%20can%20see%20on,which%20has%20the%20same%20purpose)). Dumping the process at the right time yields the decrypted code sections, albeit still virtualized/obfuscated.

- **Anti-Anti-Debug Tools:** ScyllaHide is a common user-mode plugin to hide a debugger from anti-debug checks. In Eckardt’s case, ScyllaHide needed enhancements to handle new tricks (like hooking `NtQuerySystemInformation` to fake firmware tables) ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=What%20we%20can%20do%20is,class)). In tougher scenarios, kernel-mode solutions like **TitanHide/HyperHide** can mask a debugger at the OS level, preventing the debug port or flags from revealing anything ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=deep%20rabbit%20hole%20of%20figuring,out%20what%20is%20going%20on)). The choice often depends on convenience vs. thoroughness: Eckardt’s team preferred extending user-mode hooks over dealing with kernel drivers ([Defeating VMProtect's Latest Tricks | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2023/02/09/defeating-vmprotects-latest-tricks/#:~:text=ScyllaHide%2C%20our%20anti,out%20what%20is%20going%20on)). Having a flexible arsenal (and source code access) for these tools is crucial as VMProtect’s tactics evolve.

- **Instrumentation & Taint Analysis Frameworks:** Dynamic binary instrumentation frameworks (such as Intel Pin or DynamoRIO) and *taint analysis* tools allow trackers to follow the execution and data flows in detail. A prime example is Jonathan Salwan’s use of the **Triton** framework (a dynamic symbolic execution engine) to analyze VMProtect. By instrumenting the running program, Triton can mark certain data (like inputs or the VM bytecode bytes) as symbolic and then track how they propagate through instructions. This facilitates the approach of separating VM operations from real operations in a trace ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=The%20approach)). Similarly, other researchers have leveraged **Unicorn Engine** or QEMU emulation to run VMProtect code in a controlled environment where they can log or even modify behavior on the fly (for instance, forcing the VM to dump each decoded bytecode instruction).

- **LLVM-Based Deobfuscation:** A cutting-edge technique is to lift the obfuscated code to an intermediate representation. The Secret Club “Tickling VMProtect with LLVM” series by *fvrmatteo* demonstrates writing custom LLVM passes to model VMProtect’s VM. They implemented semantics for VMProtect’s virtual instructions in C++/LLVM, then used the LLVM optimization pipeline to simplify the lifted code ([Tickling VMProtect with LLVM: Part 1 | secret club](https://secret.club/2021/09/08/vmprotect-llvm-lifting-1.html#:~:text=Semantics%20of%20the%20handlers)) ([Tickling VMProtect with LLVM: Part 1 | secret club](https://secret.club/2021/09/08/vmprotect-llvm-lifting-1.html#:~:text=template%20handlers,IR%20level)). This approach effectively treats the problem as a compiler optimization challenge – using a robust compiler framework to do the heavy lifting (literally) of devirtualizing and cleaning the code. It’s very powerful, but also requires significant development effort and understanding of both LLVM and the obfuscator.

- **Automated Devirtualization Tools:** Several public tools target VMProtect:
  - **NoVmp** (by *can1357*) – a static devirtualizer for VMProtect 3.x using the VTIL (Virtual-machine Translation Intermediate Language) framework. It lifts VMProtect VM bytecode handlers into VTIL IL and tries to reconstruct the original code. The Back Engineering blog noted NoVmp’s success on certain x64 VMP instances ([VMProtect 2 - Detailed Analysis of the Virtual Machine Architecture // Back Engineering Blog](https://blog.back.engineering/17/05/2021/#:~:text=match%20at%20L131%20,Case%20study%3A%20string%20algorithm)).
  - **VMPFix** (by *archer*) and **VMUnprotect** – other community tools aiming to automate parts of the devirtualization. These typically handle older versions or specific configurations and might not fully deobfuscate complex cases, but they can deal with simpler virtualization or at least unpack the layer.
  - **Kiwi’s VMP Disassembler** – an experiment using Triton to emulate handlers and output an IL for analysis ([KiFilterFiberContext/VMP3-Disasm - VMProtect Disassembler - GitHub](https://github.com/KiFilterFiberContext/VMP3-Disasm#:~:text=KiFilterFiberContext%2FVMP3,through%20instruction%20emulation%20using%20Triton)).

  It’s worth noting that none of these is a “one-click” solution for all VMP variants; they often require tailoring and might only support up to a certain version of VMProtect. The cat-and-mouse nature means once a tool is public, VMProtect’s authors may adjust their scheme to break that tool’s assumptions.

- **Manual Reversing & Documentation:** Ultimately, human insight is a major tool. Researchers like *Rolf Rolles* (author of a seminal WOOT 2009 paper on deobfuscation ([GitHub - JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization: Playing with the VMProtect software protection. Automatic deobfuscation of pure functions using symbolic execution and LLVM.](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/VMProtect-devirtualization/tree/main#:~:text=%5B00%5D%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Flegacy%2Fevent%2Fwoot09%2Ftech%2Ffull_papers%2Frolles.pdf%20%5B01%5D%20https%3A%2F%2Fsecret.club%2F2021%2F09%2F08%2Fvmprotect,stack%2FVMUnprotect))) and *nowaycantstay* (Habr 2023 article ([Анализ виртуальной машины на примере VMProtect.

Часть 1 / Хабр](https://habr.com/ru/articles/781592/#:~:text=%D0%9D%D0%B0%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9%20%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BB,%D0%BA%20%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%83%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%86%D1%83%20%D0%BE%D1%89%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81))) have written detailed analyses that serve as guides. They map out the overall architecture (e.g., how many bytes a typical virtual instruction is, how the dispatcher logic works, how control flow is handled in bytecode vs. native) so that others can recognize patterns. Often reverse engineers share **signatures** – for instance, bytes sequences that identify a VM entry or a particular handler prologue – which can be searched in a binary to spot VMProtect-protected functions quickly. Community forums (like Tuts4You or UnknownCheats) also contain discussions where people share tips on unpacking or defeating specific features ([[Discuss] How to unpack and reverse VMProtect (latest)](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/318281-unpack-reverse-vmprotect.html#:~:text=,to%20a%20regular%20assembly)).

- **Hardware Breakpoints and Hypervisor Tricks:** In some cases, analysts resort to hardware-supported methods. Using a hypervisor that can single-step or intercept certain instructions can bypass the malware’s attempts to detect a user-land debugger. For example, one could run the VMProtect sample inside a custom hypervisor that masks the `cpuid` hypervisor flag and emulates the exact expected CPU behavior (to avoid the trap flag detection). Tools like **Intel PT (Processor Trace)** have been suggested as well, to log execution flow at the CPU level, immune to anti-hooking tricks. These are advanced options and used when simpler methods fail.

In practice, a **combination of techniques** is used. A reverse engineer might start by unpacking and identifying protected routines, use an anti-anti-debug tool to allow single-stepping, then dump traces of those routines’ execution and feed that into a symbolic execution or decompilation tool. If the target is a known malware family, they might also **search for prior analyses** or even leaked information (indeed, there have been leaks of VMProtect’s source code in the past, which advanced researchers could study – though relying on that is legally and ethically murky). The overarching theme is **adaptability**: each VMProtect evolution demands new tricks from the reverse-engineering toolbox. As *r0da* concluded in his blog series, one can attempt quick wins with pattern matching, but truly **defeating the obfuscation often requires dynamic analysis and symbolic reasoning** ([  Quick look around VMP 3.x - Part 3 : Virtualization | r0da's Blog](https://whereisr0da.github.io/blog/posts/2021-02-16-vmp-3/#:~:text=%2A%20VIII.3%20,About%20speed)). Modern reverse engineers are effectively part-time developers, crafting bespoke tools to tear down each protection layer and sharing knowledge with the community as they uncover new methods.

Each of these researchers provided insight into VMProtect’s inner workings and the creative strategies needed to peel back its layers. Their collective work forms the basis for understanding (and eventually defeating) VMProtect’s virtualization, anti-debugging, and control-flow obfuscation mechanisms.
