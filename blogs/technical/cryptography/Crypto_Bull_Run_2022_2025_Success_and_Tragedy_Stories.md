Thanks! I’ll gather more Twitter/X stories of both success and financial tragedy during the 2022–2025 crypto bull run. I’ll highlight people who won big and those who lost life-changing amounts—especially in meme coins, scams, leverage, and emotional trading.

I’ll also analyze whether this cycle's extreme volatility and get-rich-quick culture have turned crypto into a gambling arena, and whether that poses a risk to its future adoption or perception.

I’ll get started and let you know when it’s ready.

# Crypto’s 2022–2025 Bull Run: Viral Successes and Cautionary Tales

## Major Success Stories of the 2022–2025 Bull Cycle

The 2022–2025 crypto bull run saw astonishing tales of ordinary investors and pseudonymous traders striking it rich almost overnight. A frenzy of meme coins and early-stage tokens minted new millionaires, with stories on X (Twitter) going viral as inspiration (and envy) for others. Below, we highlight some of the most famous success stories from this cycle.

### 0xSun’s $27 Million Memecoin Windfall

One of the cycle’s legendary wins came from the pseudonymous trader **0xSun**, who capitalized on the explosive launch of the official **$TRUMP** memecoin in January 2025. Within minutes of the token’s debut (a coin endorsed by the then U.S. president-elect), 0xSun deployed **3,010 Solana (SOL)** – roughly **$600,000** – to buy nearly 1 million $TRUMP tokens at around **$0.60** each ([TRUMP 吸引来的新玩家，亏了还是赚了？ - 深潮TechFlow](https://www.techflowpost.com/article/detail_23660.html#:~:text=%E9%99%A4%E4%BA%86%E9%98%B4%E8%B0%8B%E9%9B%86%E5%9B%A2%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96%EF%BC%8C24%20%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%B6%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF%E7%9A%84%E7%82%92%E5%B8%81%E5%B8%81%E5%9C%88%E5%89%8D%E9%94%8B%E6%98%AF%E6%9C%80%E6%97%A9%E5%9C%A8%20%24TRUMP%20%E4%B8%8A%E8%B5%9A%E5%88%B0%E9%92%B1%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%8D%B3%E4%BD%BF%E5%9C%A8%E5%90%84%E7%A7%8D%E3%80%8C%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E5%AE%98%E6%96%B9%E8%B4%A6%E5%8F%B7%E4%B8%80%E5%AE%9A%E6%98%AF%E8%A2%AB%E7%9B%97%E5%8F%B7%E4%BA%86%E3%80%8D%E7%9A%84%E7%8C%9C%E7%96%91%E4%B8%AD%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%A5%200xsun,6%20%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%83%EF%BC%8C%E8%8E%B7%E5%88%A9%E8%B6%85%202750%20%E4%B8%87%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%83%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%80%E6%88%98%E5%B0%81%E7%A5%9E%E3%80%82)). As $TRUMP’s price skyrocketed (driven by intense hype and exchange listings), 0xSun’s position ballooned. He publicly **posted his profit-and-loss (PnL)**, bragging: *“Made $10M onchain with public wallet in 4 hours. Welcome to crypto. Take the chance.”* ([Crypto KOL 0xSun made over 10 million dollars in profit within 4 hours through TRUMP - ChainCatcher](https://www.chaincatcher.com/en/article/2163286#:~:text=ChainCatcher%20message%2C%20Smart%20Money%2C%20crypto,Seize%20the%20opportunity)).

Cointelegraph documented other traders who similarly struck gold in the *TRUMP* launch frenzy. One wallet dubbed “**LeBron**” turned **$1 million** of USDC into over **$2 million** within minutes by aping into $TRUMP ([Traders bag millions as Trump team confirms launch of Solana memecoin](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-traders-profit-trump-solana-memecoin-frenzy#:~:text=Blockchain%20analytics%20firm%20Lookonchain%20reported,just%20minutes%20after%20the%20launch)). Another savvy trader transformed a **$1.1 million** investment into a staggering **$70 million** in under four hours – selling a portion for $3.65M and still holding $67M worth of tokens at peak value ([Traders bag millions as Trump team confirms launch of Solana memecoin](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-traders-profit-trump-solana-memecoin-frenzy#:~:text=million%20by%20acquiring%204,just%20minutes%20after%20the%20launch)). These figures, verified on-chain, underscore how **the bull cycle’s memecoin mania created overnight fortunes** for those who timed it right.

### “Wind Without Direction” – 风无向 – and Multi-Million Dollar Trades

Another prominent winner is known by the handle **风无向** (“Wind Without Direction”), a pseudonymous Chinese trader also active on X as @0x0xFeng. Renowned for his involvement in both airdrops and meme coins, 风无向 publicly shared that he was *“pulling in tens of millions (of yuan) per month”* at the height of the frenzy ([OKX 的朋友们第七期｜对话风无向：月入千万，撸毛与 MEME 双赛道的“掘金秘诀” - ChainCatcher](https://www.chaincatcher.com/article/2168750#:~:text=OKX%20%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E4%BB%AC%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%83%E6%9C%9F%EF%BD%9C%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E9%A3%8E%E6%97%A0%E5%90%91%EF%BC%9A%E6%9C%88%E5%85%A5%E5%8D%83%E4%B8%87%EF%BC%8C%E6%92%B8%E6%AF%9B%E4%B8%8E%20MEME%20%E5%8F%8C%E8%B5%9B%E9%81%93%E7%9A%84%E2%80%9C%E6%8E%98%E9%87%91%E7%A7%98%E8%AF%80%E2%80%9D)) ([OKX 的朋友们第七期｜对话风无向：月入千万，撸毛与 MEME 双赛道的“掘金秘诀” - ChainCatcher](https://www.chaincatcher.com/article/2168750#:~:text=Image)). He achieved a string of seven-figure profits on various obscure tokens. As he revealed in an interview, some of his **biggest gains came from early bets on Solana memecoins**. For instance, he cited **$BOME** and **$SLERF** as two hits – with **$SLERF netting approximately $1.2 million in profit within one hour** ([OKX的朋友們第七期｜對話風無向：月入千萬，擼毛與MEME 雙賽道的“掘金秘訣” - PANews](https://www.panewslab.com/zh_hk/articledetails/mwvwn774aakv.html#:~:text=%E6%9C%80%E6%97%A9%E6%98%AF%24BOME%E5%92%8C%24SLERF%E8%AE%93%E6%88%91%E8%B3%BA%E5%BE%97%E6%AF%94%E8%BC%83%E5%A4%9A%2C%E7%84%B6%E5%BE%8C%E5%83%8F%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%B2%93%E4%B9%9F%E8%B3%BA%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%8D%E5%B0%91%E3%80%82%20%24SLERF%E6%98%AF1%E5%B0%8F%E6%99%82120%E8%90%AC%E5%88%80%EF%BC%8C%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%B2%93%E4%B8%80%E6%99%9A%E5%A4%A7%E6%A6%82100%E8%90%AC%E5%88%80%E7%9A%84%E6%A8%A3%E5%AD%90%EF%BC%8C%E7%9B%AE%E5%89%8D%E6%98%AF%E9%80%99%E5%85%A9%E5%80%8B%E8%B3%BA%E5%BE%97%E6%AF%94%E8%BC%83%E5%A4%9A%E3%80%82%20%E4%BA%8C%E6%AE%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%A9%B1%24ChillGuy%E8%B3%BA%E5%BE%97%E4%B9%9F%E4%B8%8D%E5%B0%91%E3%80%82%E7%95%B6%E6%99%82%24CHILLGUY%E5%A4%A7%E5%80%89%E4%BD%8D%E6%8A%84%E5%BA%95%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%80%E6%B3%A2%E5%A4%A7%E5%8F%8D%E5%BD%88%E4%B8%8A%E4%BA%86%E5%A4%A7%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E6%89%80%E7%9A%84%E5%90%88%E7%B4%84%E5%B0%B1%E8%B3%A3%E6%8E%89%E3%80%82%20%24TRUMP%E5%A4%A7%E6%A6%82%E5%9D%87%E5%83%B9%E5%9C%A814%E5%88%80%E8%B2%B7%E4%BA%8660%E8%90%AC%E5%88%80%E3%80%82%E7%84%B6%E5%BE%8C%24MELANIA%E8%B2%B7%E4%BA%86%E5%A4%A7%E6%A6%82%E4%B8%8D%E5%88%B02%E7%99%BE%E8%90%AC%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E8%B3%BA%E4%BA%86%E5%B9%BE%E5%8D%81%E8%90%AC%E5%B0%B1%E8%B7%91%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82)).

### Other Viral “Get Rich Quick” Successes 

For every 0xSun or 风无向, there were dozens of lesser-known traders boasting huge wins on Crypto Twitter. **Meme coin millionaires** became a cultural phenomenon. In mid-2023, for example, the Pepe ($PEPE) token – a frog-themed meme coin – soared over 1000% in weeks. One early PEPE buyer famously turned **0.125 ETH (≈$250)** into over **$1 million in just four days** ([Pepe Coin FAQ: What You Need To Know About The Hot New ...](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/0ec52-pepe-coin-faq-crypto-hot-new-meme-coin#:~:text=Pepe%20Coin%20FAQ%3A%20What%20You,in%20just%20four%20days)). On paper, this trader held trillions of PEPE tokens worth a seven-figure sum, though liquidity constraints raised questions about how much could be cashed out ([PEPE Holder Turns $250 into $1M in Four Days.

The story nonetheless spread like wildfire as proof that even a few hundred dollars in the right coin could make someone a millionaire overnight.

Countless similar posts on X showed improbable **“from rags to riches”** trajectories: small investors flipping a few thousand dollars into six or seven figures by getting in early on micro-cap coins that caught fire. Some pseudonymous accounts (like “anti_war XX” and others in crypto trading communities) went viral for sharing screenshots of portfolio balances swelling by millions thanks to timely bets on new token launches. The **bull cycle morphed into a casino** for these speculators – and for a lucky subset, the gambles paid off spectacularly. As one observer quipped, 2023–2024’s market produced *“#memecoin millionaires”* at a pace rarely seen before.

However, lurking behind these celebratory stories was a harsher reality: for every big winner in this zero-sum game, there were many losers. The following sections explore the cautionary tales that also defined this era.

Here we recount a few representative cautionary tales – from small investors wiped out by rug-pulls to once-profitable traders who gave their winnings back.

### FOMO and Loss: The Tale of KOHA

One story illustrating the perils of FOMO (fear of missing out) is that of **“KOHA,”** a Canadian PhD student who jumped into the Trump coin late.

The initial wave of FOMO buying gave way to profit-taking. Liquidity thinned out and buy orders dried up. KOHA’s average entry was **~$36**, and suddenly his holdings turned into what he described as *“trapped liquidity”* – coins he couldn’t sell without taking a big loss ([TRUMP 吸引来的新玩家，亏了还是赚了？ - 深潮TechFlow](https://www.techflowpost.com/article/detail_23660.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L164%20%E5%9C%A8%20KOHA,%E5%B7%B2%E7%BB%8F%E4%BB%8E%20FOMO%EF%BC%88%E9%94%99%E5%A4%B1%E6%81%90%E6%83%A7%EF%BC%89%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5%E8%BF%9B%E5%85%A5%E4%BA%86%E8%8E%B7%E5%88%A9%E4%BA%86%E7%BB%93%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5%E3%80%82%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E6%B5%81%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%A7%E4%B8%8B%E9%99%8D%EF%BC%8C%E4%B9%B0%E5%8D%95%E5%87%8F%E5%B0%91%EF%BC%8CKOHA%20%E6%89%8B%E9%87%8C%E7%9A%84%E5%B8%81%E9%80%90%E6%B8%90%E5%8F%98%E6%88%90%E4%BA%86%E8%A2%AB%E5%A5%97%E7%89%A2%E7%9A%84%E6%B5%81%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%A7%EF%BC%8C%E5%9D%87%E4%BB%B7%E4%B8%BA%2036%20%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%83%E3%80%82)). He was now one of *560k* addresses in the red. The swift crash shocked him: a coin he thought had long-term promise was down over 50% from where he bought, in a matter of days. KOHA’s story is a sobering example of how **even informed individuals can be swept up in crypto hype and suffer when timing goes wrong**.

### Overconfidence and Overplaying: Li Yi’s Downfall

Another cautionary saga from the $TRUMP mania centers on **“Li Yi,”** an experienced crypto participant who *did* manage to profit initially – but then lost it all by chasing the next big thing. Li Yi had been around the block in crypto and knew that **emotion drives the market more than fundamentals** ([TRUMP 吸引来的新玩家，亏了还是赚了？ - 深潮TechFlow](https://www.techflowpost.com/article/detail_23660.html#:~:text=%E4%B8%8D%E8%BF%87%EF%BC%8C%E5%92%8C%E5%AF%B9%E5%B8%81%E5%9C%88%E6%AF%AB%E6%97%A0%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C%E7%94%9A%E8%87%B3%E4%B8%8D%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E5%B8%81%E5%9C%88%E6%9C%89%E5%93%AA%E5%87%A0%E5%A4%A7%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0%E7%9A%84%20KOHA%20%E4%B8%8D%E5%90%8C%EF%BC%8C%E6%9D%8E%E6%AF%85%E5%B7%B2%E7%BB%8F%E5%9C%A8%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%AA%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E9%87%8C%E6%91%B8%E7%88%AC%E6%BB%9A%E6%89%93%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%80%E6%AE%B5%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E3%80%82%E7%9B%B8%E6%AF%94%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%9B%E8%BF%9E%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0%E9%83%BD%E4%B8%8D%E7%86%9F%E6%82%89%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E6%9D%8E%E6%AF%85%E8%87%B3%E5%B0%91%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E8%AF%A5%20%E5%8E%BB%E5%93%AA%E9%87%8C%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%EF%BC%8C%E4%B9%9F%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E5%B8%81%E5%9C%88%E7%9A%84%E9%80%BB%E8%BE%91%E5%B9%B6%E4%B8%8D%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%EF%BC%8C%E6%83%85%E7%BB%AA%E6%89%8D%E6%98%AF%E5%94%AF%E4%B8%80%E7%9A%84%E5%86%B3%E5%AE%9A%E5%9B%A0%E7%B4%A0%E3%80%82%E6%9D%8E%E6%AF%85%E6%B7%B7%E8%BF%B9%E4%BA%8E%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%AA%E7%82%92%E5%B8%81%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81%E7%BE%A4%EF%BC%8C%E6%97%B6%E5%88%BB%E5%85%B3%E6%B3%A8%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81%EF%BC%8C%E7%B4%A7%E8%B7%9F%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%E8%87%AA%E7%A7%B0%E3%80%8C%E5%B8%81%E5%9C%88%E8%80%81%E7%82%AE%E3%80%8D%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%91%98%E4%B9%B0%E5%8D%96%E3%80%82)). He lurked in trading chat groups, following calls from self-proclaimed “crypto veterans.” This strategy worked early on: **Li Yi got into $TRUMP around $17 and sold after the price exploded**, securing a tidy gain ([TRUMP 吸引来的新玩家，亏了还是赚了？ - 深潮TechFlow](https://www.techflowpost.com/article/detail_23660.html#:~:text=%E4%BB%96%E7%A1%AE%E5%AE%9E%E8%B5%9A%E5%88%B0%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%80%E7%AC%94%E3%80%82)). Had he stopped there, he would have been a winner.

However, flush with his success, Li Yi grew **overconfident and greedy**. Rather than withdraw or hold his profits, he immediately went looking for “**the next $TRUMP**” ([TRUMP 吸引来的新玩家，亏了还是赚了？ - 深潮TechFlow](https://www.techflowpost.com/article/detail_23660.html#:~:text=%E8%B5%9A%E5%88%B0%E9%92%B1%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E6%9D%8E%E6%AF%85%E5%B9%B6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E7%A6%BB%E5%9C%BA%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E5%AF%BB%E6%89%BE%E3%80%8C%E4%B8%8B%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%20%24TRUMP%E3%80%8D%E3%80%82)). He didn’t have to look far. Just two days after $TRUMP’s launch, a flurry of copycat **“Trump family” meme coins** appeared – notably **$MELANIA** (named after the First Lady) and rumor-driven tokens claiming to be related to Trump’s son Barron or even his family’s nanny ([TRUMP 吸引来的新玩家，亏了还是赚了？ - 深潮TechFlow](https://www.techflowpost.com/article/detail_23660.html#:~:text=%E6%9E%9C%E7%84%B6%EF%BC%8C%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E5%AE%B6%E6%97%8F%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E8%AE%A9%E6%9D%8E%E6%AF%85%E5%A4%B1%E6%9C%9B%EF%BC%8C%E5%9C%A8%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E5%B8%81%E5%8F%91%E8%A1%8C%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%A4%E5%A4%A9%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E8%80%81%E5%A9%86%E5%B8%81%E6%A2%85%E6%8B%89%E5%B0%BC%E5%A8%85%E5%B8%81%EF%BC%88%24MELANIA%EF%BC%89%E5%8F%91%E8%A1%8C%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82%E4%B8%8E%E6%AD%A4%E5%90%8C%E6%97%B6%EF%BC%8C%E5%9C%A8%E7%82%92%E5%B8%81%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81%E7%BE%A4%E9%87%8C%EF%BC%8C%E3%80%8C%E5%AE%B6%E6%97%8F%E5%B8%81%E3%80%8D%E6%A6%82%E5%BF%B5%20%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E6%B5%81%E8%A1%8C%E8%B5%B7%E6%9D%A5%E3%80%82)).

### Rug Pulls, Liquidations, and Regret: The Dark Side of the Mania

It wasn’t only novice retail traders caught on the losing side. Even large players (so-called crypto “whales”) sometimes misjudged the top. In the $TRUMP saga, one Solana whale initially made money but then rode the coin back down and beyond. Blockchain analysis shows this whale only profited on their first $TRUMP trade, but **lost money on the next three trades, ending up with a cumulative loss of roughly $15.7 million** ([数据：某巨鲸 10.66 美元卖出 74.39 万枚 TRUMP，累计亏损达 1570 万美元 - ChainCatcher](https://www.chaincatcher.com/article/2174660#:~:text=ChainCatcher%20%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%8D%AE%20Lookonchain%20%E7%9B%91%E6%B5%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%9F%90%E5%B7%A8%E9%B2%B8%E4%BA%94%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%B6%E5%89%8D%E4%BB%A5%2010,743%2C947%20%E6%9E%9A%20TRUMP%EF%BC%8C%E6%8D%9F%E5%A4%B1%20330%20%E4%B8%87%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%83%E3%80%82)). Another major holder who had bought in late ultimately capitulated on March 28, 2025: they **sold off 590,000 $TRUMP at about $10.62 each, swallowing a $1.68 million loss** (around 20% of their position value) ([数据：某 TRUMP 巨鲸清仓 59 万枚代币，亏损 167.7 万美元 - ChainCatcher](https://www.chaincatcher.com/article/2174644#:~:text=%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%89%AB%E7%A0%81)). Their large sell even pushed the price down another 3% in a self-fulfilling cycle of decline ([数据：某 TRUMP 巨鲸清仓 59 万枚代币，亏损 167.7 万美元 - ChainCatcher](https://www.chaincatcher.com/article/2174644#:~:text=ChainCatcher%20%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%8D%AE%20%40ai_9684xtpa%20%E7%9B%91%E6%B5%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%9F%90%20TRUMP,%E3%80%82)). These examples show that **even well-capitalized actors were not immune to the brutal whipsaw of meme coin speculation**.

At the retail level, the bull run left a trail of heartbreak and, in some cases, personal ruin. One poignant account circulated on Reddit under the title *“Everyone who has lost money on SOL meme coins”*. The author shared, *“In the past month, I’ve experienced significant financial losses — around $30,000… I lost 90% of my investment in a single day due to a rug pull.”* ([Everyone who has lost money on SOL meme coins : r/solana](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1cjofdh/everyone_who_has_lost_money_on_sol_meme_coins/#:~:text=I%27m%20sharing%20something%20personal%20because,It%27s%20tough)). He described the aftermath: frantically trying to recoup by chasing new tips on Telegram and Twitter, only to dig himself deeper. *“I wiped out my entire savings, transitioning from a comfortable life to living paycheck to paycheck,”* he wrote, calling it a **devastating, soul-crushing experience** ([Everyone who has lost money on SOL meme coins : r/solana](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1cjofdh/everyone_who_has_lost_money_on_sol_meme_coins/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20despite%20the%20devastation%2C%20it%27s,harsher%20consequences%20down%20the%20line)). In an update, this trader explained how it happened: he started with a small $200 punt on a meme coin which unexpectedly mooned – then “couldn’t resist pouring in more money as the value soared.” When the “inevitable crash” came, he **doubled down naively to catch a rebound**, but the coin kept plunging ([Everyone who has lost money on SOL meme coins : r/solana](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1cjofdh/everyone_who_has_lost_money_on_sol_meme_coins/#:~:text=So%2C%20here%27s%20how%20it%20all,extent%20of%20it%2C%20I%2C%20like)). What had seemed like a golden ticket turned into a nightmare as liquidity was locked and exit scammers dumped tokens. *“By the time I understood the extent of it, I, like thousands of others, had lost a significant amount,”* he recounted, noting even influencer “callers” in the token’s group chat admitted defeat (one claimed a $100k loss) ([Everyone who has lost money on SOL meme coins : r/solana](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1cjofdh/everyone_who_has_lost_money_on_sol_meme_coins/#:~:text=inevitable%20crash,to%20lost%20money%20in%20this)). The coin, which had been **“meticulously crafted” with a slick website and even articles on major crypto sites, hit a $30 million market cap and then crashed to ~$500k** – essentially approaching worthless ([Everyone who has lost money on SOL meme coins : r/solana](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1cjofdh/everyone_who_has_lost_money_on_sol_meme_coins/#:~:text=It%20was%20a%20meticulously%20crafted,A%20bitter%20pill%20to%20swallow)). This story was a sobering reminder of how **ruthless rug-pulls preyed on bull market optimism**, leaving ordinary people to pick up the pieces of their finances. (*“There’s a lesson in this pain,”* the Redditor concluded, *“I just hope it prevents others from making the same mistakes.”* ([Everyone who has lost money on SOL meme coins : r/solana](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1cjofdh/everyone_who_has_lost_money_on_sol_meme_coins/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20despite%20the%20devastation%2C%20it%27s,harsher%20consequences%20down%20the%20line)))

From these tragic tales, a pattern emerges: **easy come, easy go**. The bull cycle’s very structure – extreme volatility, reflexive hype, and lack of oversight – meant that what shot up could crash down just as fast. As one Chinese outlet noted, the cycle was like an “open gamble” where everyone put their cards on the table: projects no longer even pretended to have real tech or business plans, it was all about *“炒情绪, 炒话题”* – speculating purely on emotions and narratives ([TRUMP 吸引来的新玩家，亏了还是赚了？ - 深潮TechFlow](https://www.techflowpost.com/article/detail_23660.html#:~:text=%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%80%E8%BD%AE%E5%91%A8%E6%9C%9F%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%98%E5%8C%96%E6%98%AF%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%B6%E9%83%BD%E6%91%8A%E7%89%8C%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82)). In such an environment, many participants learned hard lessons about risk management, greed, and the dangers of a get-rich-quick mindset.

## Crypto or Casino? The Get-Rich-Quick Culture vs. Long-Term Legitimacy

The dramatic success and failure stories of the 2022–2025 bull run fueled a growing debate: **Has crypto essentially turned into a giant gambling arena?** During this cycle, especially in the frothy 2024–25 period, even industry veterans observed that speculative fever was drowning out technological or fundamental value. *“This round of the bull market is straightforward and brutal – directly hyping sentiment, celebrities, topics… using FOMO to spawn a series of new shitcoins and harvest new investors,”* one Chinese crypto columnist wrote, noting that unlike past cycles, there was no need to even pretend a meme project had tech utility ([TRUMP 吸引来的新玩家，亏了还是赚了？ - 深潮TechFlow](https://www.techflowpost.com/article/detail_23660.html#:~:text=%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%80%E8%BD%AE%E5%91%A8%E6%9C%9F%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A7%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%98%E5%8C%96%E6%98%AF%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%B6%E9%83%BD%E6%91%8A%E7%89%8C%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82)). **The culture of instant riches** – exemplified by viral memes of Pepe millionaires or Trumpcoin lottery-winners – led many to compare crypto trading to a casino. In effect, the **bull run blurred the line between investing and gambling** for a huge swath of market participants.

Top crypto experts and market observers have voiced concern that this get-rich-quick ethos is **damaging the industry’s long-term credibility**. After the Trump memecoin saga, *multiple crypto executives publicly criticized the move*, worrying that it **“could seriously harm crypto’s overall reputation”** ([特朗普夫妇meme币遭批评，多位加密高管警告：或损害行业声誉](https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3739607#:~:text=%E4%B8%8D%E5%B0%91%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86%E8%B4%A7%E5%B8%81%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A%E7%9A%84%E9%AB%98%E7%AE%A1%E5%AF%B9%E6%AD%A4%E8%A1%A8%E8%BE%BE%E4%BA%86%E5%BC%BA%E7%83%88%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8D%E6%BB%A1%E3%80%82%E4%BB%96%E4%BB%AC%E8%AE%A4%E4%B8%BA%E8%BF%99%E7%A7%8Dmeme%E5%B8%81%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E4%BC%9A%E4%B8%A5%E9%87%8D%E6%8D%9F%E5%AE%B3%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86%E8%B4%A7%E5%B8%81%E7%9A%84%E6%95%B4%E4%BD%93%E5%A3%B0%E8%AA%89%EF%BC%8C%E5%AF%B9%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E6%9C%AC%E4%BA%BA%E4%BB%A5%E5%8F%8A%E6%95%B4%E4%B8%AA%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86%E8%B4%A7%E5%B8%81%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A%E9%83%BD%E5%B8%A6%E6%9D%A5%E8%B4%9F%E9%9D%A2%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8D%E3%80%82%E4%BB%96%E4%BB%AC%E5%8E%9F%E6%9C%AC%E8%BF%98%E7%9B%BC%20%E7%9D%80%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%80%E5%B1%8A%E5%85%B1%E5%92%8C%E5%85%9A%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E8%83%BD%E8%AE%A4%E7%9C%9F%E6%8E%A8%E5%8A%A8%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E8%B5%84%E4%BA%A7%E9%A2%86%E5%9F%9F%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%EF%BC%8C%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%9C%E5%8D%B4%E5%86%92%E5%87%BA%E4%BA%86%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%A4%E4%B8%AA%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84meme%E5%B8%81%EF%BC%8C%E8%AE%A9%E4%BB%96%E4%BB%AC%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%B1%E6%89%80%E6%9C%9B%E3%80%82)). They had hoped for more serious engagement with crypto from a new administration, only to see attention diverted to frothy meme tokens. **Rob Hadick, a partner at Dragonfly Capital, lamented:** “Trump family issuing meme tokens is clearly a stain, and we as industry builders will have to work hard to overcome it.” ([特朗普夫妇meme币遭批评，多位加密高管警告：或损害行业声誉](https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3739607#:~:text=%E4%B8%93%E6%B3%A8%E4%BA%8E%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86%E8%B4%A7%E5%B8%81%E7%9A%84%E9%A3%8E%E9%99%A9%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8Dragonfly%20Capital%E7%9A%84%E6%99%AE%E9%80%9A%E5%90%88%E4%BC%99%E4%BA%BARob%20Hadick%E8%A1%A8%E7%A4%BA%EF%BC%9A)) Likewise, former Coinbase CTO **Balaji Srinivasan** blasted the trend, saying *“meme tokens are a zero-sum ‘lottery’, [their] price will eventually collapse, and the last buyers will lose everything.”* ([特朗普夫妇meme币遭批评，多位加密高管警告：或损害行业声誉](https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3739607#:~:text=%E5%89%8D%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86%E8%B4%A7%E5%B8%81%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E6%89%80Coinbase%E7%9A%84%E9%A6%96%E5%B8%AD%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%AE%98%E3%80%81%E5%A4%A9%E4%BD%BF%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84%E4%BA%BABalaji%20Srinivasan%E5%9C%A8%E7%A4%BE%E4%BA%A4%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93X%E4%B8%8A%E5%8F%91%E6%96%87%E7%A7%B0%EF%BC%9A)).

Even some crypto-friendly figures warned that the *“get-rich-quick culture”* surrounding meme coins was **eroding trust**. *Gabor Gurbacs*, a veteran of investment firm VanEck, argued that the Trump memecoin episode *“made the US, the presidency, and his family lose a lot of credibility”*, hinting that the fallout was only beginning to be felt ([特朗普夫妇meme币遭批评，多位加密高管警告：或损害行业声誉](https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3739607#:~:text=SkyBridge%20Capital%20LLC%E5%88%9B%E5%A7%8B%E4%BA%BAAnthony%20Scaramucci%E5%9C%A8%E7%A4%BE%E4%BA%A4%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E4%B8%8A%E6%8C%87%E5%87%BA%EF%BC%8C%E6%A2%85%E6%8B%89%E5%B0%BC%E5%A8%85%E5%B8%81%E7%9A%84%E6%8E%A8%E5%87%BA%E5%AF%BC%E8%87%B4%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E5%B8%81%E4%BB%B7%E6%A0%BC%E4%B8%8B%E8%B7%8C%E3%80%82Scaramucci%20%E6%9B%BE%E5%9C%A82017%E5%B9%B4%E7%9F%AD%E6%9A%82%E6%8B%85%E4%BB%BB%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E7%9A%84%E9%80%9A%E8%AE%AF%E8%81%94%E7%BB%9C%E4%B8%BB%E4%BB%BB%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%8E%E8%A2%AB%E8%A7%A3%E8%81%8C%E5%B9%B6%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E7%9A%84%E6%89%B9%E8%AF%84%E8%80%85%E3%80%82)). In his view, such antics feed into the narrative that crypto is not a serious financial innovation but a toy for speculation.

Crucially, this culture could invite **regulatory backlash and societal skepticism**. Around the world, regulators and lawmakers have taken note of the casino-like behavior in crypto markets. In the UK, a Treasury Committee report in 2023 bluntly concluded that **“consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service”** and **should be regulated as such** ([Cryptocurrency trading in UK should be regulated as form of gambling, say MPs | Cryptocurrencies | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/17/cryptocurrency-trading-in-uk-should-be-regulated-as-form-of-gambling-say-mps#:~:text=UK%20authorities%20should%20regulate%20cryptocurrency,fresh%20inquiry%20into%20the%20industry)) ([Cryptocurrency trading in UK should be regulated as form of gambling, say MPs | Cryptocurrencies | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/17/cryptocurrency-trading-in-uk-should-be-regulated-as-form-of-gambling-say-mps#:~:text=%E2%80%9CEffective%20regulation%20is%20clearly%20needed,should%20be%20regulated%20as%20such)). The committee chair warned that with “no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good,” unbacked crypto speculation could lead consumers to *“lose life-changing sums of money,”* just like betting in a sportsbook ([Cryptocurrency trading in UK should be regulated as form of gambling, say MPs | Cryptocurrencies | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/17/cryptocurrency-trading-in-uk-should-be-regulated-as-form-of-gambling-say-mps#:~:text=Like%20gambling%2C%20cryptocurrency%20trading%20and,changing%20sums%20of%20cash)). This view – that much of crypto is effectively **high-stakes wagering** – is gaining traction. Regulators fear that the get-rich-quick frenzy not only harms individuals but, if left unchecked, could destabilize parts of the financial system or at least dupe large numbers of citizens into dangerous losses. 

Recent events provided fodder for crypto’s critics. In early 2025, Argentina’s president **Javier Milei** promoted a new cryptocurrency ($LIBRA) to his supporters as a boon for the economy – only for it to rug pull within hours, **vaporizing around $100 million and the savings of some of his loyal followers** ([Javier Milei’s Meme Coin Boondoggle](https://jacobin.com/2025/02/milei-crypto-musk-argentina#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cpromote%20economic%20growth%20in%20Argentina,of%20Milei%E2%80%99s%20most%20ardent%20supporters)) ([Javier Milei’s Meme Coin Boondoggle](https://jacobin.com/2025/02/milei-crypto-musk-argentina#:~:text=Due%20to%20Milei%E2%80%99s%20saintlike%20status,Argentina%20and%20the%20United%20States)). The scandal provoked national outrage, lawsuits, and even calls for impeachment ([Javier Milei’s Meme Coin Boondoggle](https://jacobin.com/2025/02/milei-crypto-musk-argentina#:~:text=currency%20seemed%20like%20a%20safe,Argentina%20and%20the%20United%20States)) ([Javier Milei’s Meme Coin Boondoggle](https://jacobin.com/2025/02/milei-crypto-musk-argentina#:~:text=Political%20personalities%20across%20the%20Argentine,popular%20support%20in%20December%202023)). While this was an extreme case, it underscored the point: **when crypto starts to look like a get-rich-quick scam, public trust can evaporate and regulators will intervene**. In Milei’s case, the political blowback was immediate. In other jurisdictions, the response may be stricter rules treating certain crypto activities akin to gambling or outright crackdowns on meme coin frauds.

Ultimately, the 2022–2025 bull run forced the crypto community to confront a difficult question: can the industry sustain its **long-term legitimacy as a revolutionary financial/technological innovation** if much of the participation devolves into speculative gambling? Optimists argue that each cycle brings new entrants for speculative reasons who eventually become interested in real crypto technology, and that innovation continues beneath the froth. Indeed, even amid the chaos, Bitcoin reached all-time highs and serious developments (like Layer-2 scaling and regulatory frameworks) progressed. But the **“casino culture”** of this bull run undoubtedly left a mark. It **reinforced skeptics’ views** that crypto is all greater-fool hype, and it **strengthened calls for tighter oversight** to protect consumers. 

As the market cycle turns, the crypto world is left balancing those viral tales of spectacular wealth against the very real human costs of the busts. The hope among true believers is that the industry can shed its image of a Wild West casino and mature – focusing on sustainable growth and genuine use-cases. If not, the next chapter could see harsher regulation treating crypto more like gambling, which might fundamentally change the landscape. In short, the bull run showed both the **thrilling promise and the perilous pitfalls** of the crypto dream. Whether those wild gains were worth the equally dramatic pain is a question that lingers, as the community reckons with how to evolve beyond the get-rich-quick mindset that dominated this cycle.
