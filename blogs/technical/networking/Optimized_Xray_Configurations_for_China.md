I’ll report back with the best practices, protocol choices (e.g., VLESS, VMess, Trojan), transport options (e.g., XTLS, gRPC, Reality), recommended server locations, and security considerations for achieving high reliability within mainland China.

# Optimized Xray Configurations for Mainland China

Mainland Chinese users are among the most experienced in bypassing censorship, and the Great Firewall’s (GFW) evolution has given rise to many “sneaky” circumvention techniques ([Notes of Xray — the censorship buster | by Eugene Bogorad | Medium](https://bogorad.medium.com/notes-of-xray-the-censorship-buster-c955969057b5#:~:text=There%20are%20myriad%20ways%20of,tech%20is%20to%20the%20rescue)). This guide provides an in-depth analysis of **optimal Xray proxy configurations for use in China**, focusing on effective GFW evasion with strong performance and stability. We draw on community forums (e.g. VPS and Linux.do communities) and recent best practices to cover protocols, transports, TLS fingerprinting, server setup, and hardening tips.

## 1. Choosing the Right Protocol (VMess, VLESS, Trojan, etc.)

**Available Protocols:** Xray (Project X) supports V2Ray’s family of protocols. The main choices are:
- **VMess:** The original V2Ray protocol with built-in encryption/obfuscation. Effective in the past, but now **less recommended for China** as its static patterns can be recognized if not layered under TLS. GFW’s 2022 TLS-blocking campaign targeted VMess along with others ([Large scale blocking of TLS-based censorship circumvention tools in China · Issue #129 · net4people/bbs · GitHub](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/129#:~:text=include%20trojan%2C%20Xray%2C%20V2Ray%20TLS%2BWebsocket%2C,the%20blocking%20of%20naiveproxy%20though)).
- **VLESS:** A newer, lightweight protocol (no built-in encryption) meant to be used with external encryption (TLS/XTLS). **Highly extensible and efficient**, making it ideal to combine with advanced obfuscation like XTLS Vision and REALITY. Many Chinese users have shifted to VLESS for its performance and flexibility ([Trojan vs. VLESS. Comparison of VPN Protocols | by Vitaliy Podolskiy | Medium](https://medium.com/@onlyapps/trojan-vs-vless-comparison-of-vpn-protocols-7f8bb72f4cbd#:~:text=,VPN%20protocols%20may%20be%20blocked)) ([Trojan vs. VLESS. Comparison of VPN Protocols | by Vitaliy Podolskiy | Medium](https://medium.com/@onlyapps/trojan-vs-vless-comparison-of-vpn-protocols-7f8bb72f4cbd#:~:text=,Trojan%20requires%20more%20thorough%20configuration)).
- **Trojan:** A proxy protocol that **disguises as standard TLS** (HTTPS) by using port 443 and a valid TLS certificate. It was long favored for blending in with normal traffic ([Trojan vs. VLESS. Comparison of VPN Protocols | by Vitaliy Podolskiy | Medium](https://medium.com/@onlyapps/trojan-vs-vless-comparison-of-vpn-protocols-7f8bb72f4cbd#:~:text=Trojan)) ([Trojan vs. VLESS. Comparison of VPN Protocols | by Vitaliy Podolskiy | Medium](https://medium.com/@onlyapps/trojan-vs-vless-comparison-of-vpn-protocols-7f8bb72f4cbd#:~:text=Trojan%20is%20a%20modern%20VPN,the%20likelihood%20of%20its%20blocking)). However, reports since late 2022 indicate **Trojan servers getting detected and blocked** within days unless extra measures are taken ([Detected? · Issue #659 · trojan-gfw/trojan · GitHub](https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan/issues/659#:~:text=Leetroch%20%20%20commented%20,72)). GFW’s active probing can reveal Trojan if the server doesn’t respond like a real web service. 

**Effectiveness in China:**
- **VLESS + TLS/XTLS:** Currently seen as a top choice. With proper configuration (detailed below), VLESS can be made nearly indistinguishable from normal TLS, while avoiding VMess’s static handshake patterns. It’s also simpler to set up than Trojan in some cases ([Trojan vs. VLESS. Comparison of VPN Protocols | by Vitaliy Podolskiy | Medium](https://medium.com/@onlyapps/trojan-vs-vless-comparison-of-vpn-protocols-7f8bb72f4cbd#:~:text=,VLESS%20also%20utilizes%20this%20capability)).
- **Trojan:** Still effective **when carefully tuned**. Trojan natively looks like HTTPS, but GFW has adapted: users found pure Trojan on 443 **was blocked repeatedly**, suggesting TLS fingerprint or traffic flow gave it away ([Detected? · Issue #659 · trojan-gfw/trojan · GitHub](https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan/issues/659#:~:text=Leetroch%20%20%20commented%20,72)). To use Trojan now, one should incorporate techniques like uTLS (to mimic browser fingerprints) or route it behind a CDN to avoid direct inspection ([Detected? · Issue #659 · trojan-gfw/trojan · GitHub](https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan/issues/659#:~:text=Leetroch%20%20%20commented%20,72)).
- **VMess:** If used, it should always be over TLS (e.g. as WS+TLS) to have any chance in China. Even then, community consensus is that **VMess is weaker** against detection compared to Trojan or VLESS with new features. Many guides have deprecated VMess in favor of VLESS.
- **Other protocols:** Xray can also tunnel Shadowsocks or even WireGuard, but these are outside our scope. Notably, naiveproxy (which uses Chrome’s TLS) remains unblocked since it presents a *perfectly genuine TLS fingerprint* ([Large scale blocking of TLS-based censorship circumvention tools in China · Issue #129 · net4people/bbs · GitHub](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/129#:~:text=fortuna%20%20%20commented%20,98)). In Xray, achieving a similar effect is possible via uTLS (see §3).

**Community Recommendation:** A prevalent recommendation in 2023–2024 is to use **VLESS** with the latest obfuscation features. For example, a forum member suggests *“VLESS + REALITY + XTLS-Vision”* as the most robust combo ([Need to bypass chinese firewall — LowEndTalk](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/196208/need-to-bypass-chinese-firewall#:~:text=Image%3A%20FranzkafkaFranzkafka%20%20Member)). This leverages VLESS for flexibility, REALITY for TLS camouflage, and XTLS Vision for efficiency – all implemented in Xray core.

## 2. Transport Layer Options (TLS, XTLS, gRPC, WS, H2, Reality)

How you encapsulate Xray traffic greatly impacts both **stealth and performance**. Common transport layers include TLS (over TCP) and various multiplexed or masked tunnels. Below we compare them in the Chinese context:

- **TLS over TCP (Standard TLS):** Using TLS on port 443 is the baseline for camouflage – all protocols (VMess, VLESS, Trojan) typically run inside TLS to appear as HTTPS. On its own, this makes traffic **encrypted and protocol-agnostic**, but naive implementations have identifiable TLS fingerprints. GFW’s large-scale blocking in late 2022 **targeted TLS-based proxies** (VMess, VLESS, Trojan, etc.) by their TLS quirks ([Large scale blocking of TLS-based censorship circumvention tools in China · Issue #129 · net4people/bbs · GitHub](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/129#:~:text=include%20trojan%2C%20Xray%2C%20V2Ray%20TLS%2BWebsocket%2C,the%20blocking%20of%20naiveproxy%20though)). Therefore, standard TLS alone is no longer sufficient without tweaks like uTLS (detailed later). Always use a **valid SNI** (server name) in the TLS handshake that corresponds to an innocuous domain.

- **WebSocket + TLS (WS+TLS):** Transports the proxy stream inside a WebSocket, which itself is upgraded from an HTTP(S) request. This was a popular method:
  - **Pros:** Easy to deploy, and when combined with Cloudflare CDN, the traffic looks like regular WebSocket over HTTPS to a benign host. Many Chinese users route VLESS/VMess WS through Cloudflare to hide the true server ([I have been researching VPN protocols that work in China and found that Xray [0]... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37074328#:~:text=I%20have%20been%20researching%20VPN,about%20how%20well%20it%20works)). This also helps performance by leveraging CDN nodes near China.
  - **Cons:** Adds extra overhead (HTTP headers and WS framing). Also, GFW has learned patterns of long-lived WebSocket connections. In fact, China’s crackdown impacted **TLS+WebSocket servers** significantly ([Large scale blocking of TLS-based censorship circumvention tools in China · Issue #129 · net4people/bbs · GitHub](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/129#:~:text=include%20trojan%2C%20Xray%2C%20V2Ray%20TLS%2BWebsocket%2C,the%20blocking%20of%20naiveproxy%20though)). Without a CDN, a direct WS connection can be fingerprinted by flow behaviors. 
  - **Usage:** If using WS, prefer to proxy it behind a CDN or at least use a **randomized path** and respond with plausible HTTP content on that path when probed. Ensure the TLS certificate and SNI are for the domain being used (often a domain fronting through CDN).
  
- **gRPC + TLS (HTTP/2):** Encapsulates traffic in HTTP/2 streams (often via a gRPC service call). Functionally similar to WS:
  - **Pros:** Slightly more efficient than WS (binary framing, less overhead). gRPC traffic can look like a normal HTTP/2 API call. Cloudflare and other CDN providers support HTTP/2 and even gRPC pass-through, so this is also commonly used behind CDN. Users report gRPC tends to have lower latency than WS under the same conditions (due to HTTP/2 multiplexing).
  - **Cons:** Likewise, direct gRPC without CDN was among those blocked by GFW’s TLS filters ([Large scale blocking of TLS-based censorship circumvention tools in China · Issue #129 · net4people/bbs · GitHub](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/129#:~:text=,comment)). It’s effective *only* if it truly appears as regular HTTP/2 – which means using a legit domain and path. If not behind a CDN, consider deploying a real HTTP/2 web service on the same domain to mask the gRPC endpoint.
  - **Tip:** When behind Cloudflare, set **`alpn` to “h2”** in Xray’s config to prefer HTTP/2, and use a **random or benign serviceName** for gRPC. On some networks, gRPC (HTTP/2) may pass when WS is reset, due to differences in packet patterns.

- **HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 (QUIC) direct:** Xray can also transport via pure HTTP/2 without gRPC, or QUIC (HTTP/3) if enabled:
  - **H2 Direct:** Similar to gRPC, but you’d be manually sending HTTP/2 frames. This is less common than gRPC usage, but under the hood gRPC is just a specific HTTP/2 usage, so risks are similar. Some advanced setups use H2 with a CDN and *XHTTP* (an Xray feature) for fronting ([how to use fragment in xray core? · Issue #2392 · XTLS/Xray-core · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/issues/2392#:~:text=,can%20be%20configured%20as%20follows)).
  - **QUIC (H3):** Xray supports QUIC in some modes (e.g., Xray’s XHTTP can negotiate H3 if server and client set `alpn: "h3"` ([how to use fragment in xray core? · Issue #2392 · XTLS/Xray-core · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/issues/2392#:~:text=Loading))). QUIC can improve performance on high-loss networks, but **UDP 443 traffic might attract blocking** – China has in the past blocked Google’s QUIC. Use with caution. If QUIC is allowed, it could boost speed, but have a fallback to TLS in case QUIC is dropped.

- **XTLS (Xray TLS) with Vision:** XTLS is a custom transport optimization introduced by Xray:
  - **XTLS Direct vs. Splice:** Originally, XTLS allowed skipping redundant encryption by **merging the TLS of the proxy with the outer TLS**. This removed the “TLS-in-TLS” overhead for much faster throughput (fewer copies and lower latency). It came in modes like `direct` or `splice` for different behaviors. However, standard XTLS had issues with maintainability and some fingerprinting.
  - **XTLS-Vision:** *Vision* is the latest iteration – essentially a refined XTLS flow control labeled `xtls-rprx-vision` in configs. It adds features like inner handshake padding and better compatibility ([VLESS - Project X](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/outbounds/vless.html#:~:text=VLESS%20,vision)) ([VLESS（XTLS Vision Seed） - Project X](https://xtls.github.io/config/outbounds/vless.html#:~:text=xtls,vision%20%2C%20%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%8D%E4%BC%9A%E6%8B%A6%E6%88%AA%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E4%B8%BA443%20%E7%AB%AF%E5%8F%A3%E7%9A%84UDP)). Vision mode **eliminates the detectable pattern of TLS-in-TLS** by making the proxy traffic appear more like normal TLS data ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=Reality%20can%20eliminate%20server%20tls,eliminate%20client%20tls%20fingerprint%20characteristics)).
  - **Pros:** Extremely fast – minimal overhead, suitable for high-bandwidth use (streaming, gaming) with low CPU usage. When combined with REALITY (next) and uTLS, it’s part of the most robust config ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=Reality%20can%20eliminate%20server%20tls,eliminate%20client%20tls%20fingerprint%20characteristics)).
  - **Cons:** **Cannot be used through a CDN** ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=vision%2Butls%20should%20be%20the%20best,Choice)). XTLS is a custom transport, so you need a direct client-to-server connection (the traffic isn’t actually pure HTTPS, it’s optimized). This means your server’s IP is exposed to GFW. It’s best used if you can secure a stable, unblocked IP (or can change IPs quickly). Also, XTLS requires using Xray-specific clients (recent v2rayN, v2rayNG, etc., support it).

- **REALITY (TLS Camouflage Protocol):** A cutting-edge feature in Xray-core (since v1.7.5+):
  - **What it is:** REALITY is an advanced obfuscation that **implements a full TLS handshake with a fake SNI (domain)**, without needing a real certificate ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=Xray,REALITY)) ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=REALITY%20implements%20full%20TLS%20using,greater%20security%20than%20conventional%20TLS)). It essentially **eliminates the server’s TLS fingerprint** by making the server hello *identical to a real website’s* (e.g. imitating a popular allowed domain) ([Xray with Reality+ Vision+ uTLS.

The Xray server presents a cipher and handshake that looks genuine, yet carries an encrypted payload for authentication.
  - **How it works:** The server uses a known public key of a target site (e.g. `www.bing.com`) and performs a custom TLS handshake. From an observer’s view, the client appears to be talking to Bing on a standard TLS connection. Under the hood, the handshake is intercepted – additional data in the hello is used for client-server auth and then the proxy connection proceeds ([Xray with Reality+ Vision+ uTLS. Use your own proxy/ VPN and get rid of… | by j3ffyang | Medium](https://j3ffyang.medium.com/xray-with-reality-vision-utls-3abfb63b682e#:~:text=In%20essence%2C%20REALITY%20relies%20on,The%20process%20involves)) ([Xray with Reality+ Vision+ uTLS. Use your own proxy/ VPN and get rid of… | by j3ffyang | Medium](https://j3ffyang.medium.com/xray-with-reality-vision-utls-3abfb63b682e#:~:text=,validation%20to%20proceed%20with%20communication)). This **cleverly leverages whitelisted domains’ TLS characteristics** to blend in.
  - **Pros:** **No domain or cert needed on your part** (you don’t have to buy a domain or run ACME for certificates) ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=Since%20IP%20addresses%20frequently%20get,server%E2%80%99s%20IP%20address%20whenever%20necessary)). By spoofing an SNI that is definitely allowed (like a major CDN or tech site), REALITY defeats **“SNI whitelisting” censorship** where only traffic to certain hosts is permitted ([How does XTLS REALITY break through the whitelist? REALITY source code analysis - ObjShadow's Blog](https://objshadow.pages.dev/en/posts/how-reality-works/#:~:text=Since%20some%20areas%20in%20mainland,unavailable%20in%20these%20areas%20overnight)) ([How does XTLS REALITY break through the whitelist? REALITY source code analysis - ObjShadow's Blog](https://objshadow.pages.dev/en/posts/how-reality-works/#:~:text=Since%20some%20areas%20in%20mainland,unavailable%20in%20these%20areas%20overnight)). It also provides perfect forward secrecy and is more secure than older TLS hacks ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=REALITY%20implements%20full%20TLS%20using,greater%20security%20than%20conventional%20TLS)). In short, REALITY is currently the **state-of-the-art** for making your proxy traffic look innocuous.
  - **Cons:** Like XTLS, REALITY demands direct connectivity (you **cannot proxy REALITY through Cloudflare or other CDN**). The custom handshake won’t be understood by a CDN terminating TLS. Thus, you trade off the IP camouflage a CDN provides. REALITY works best in conjunction with **XTLS-Vision and uTLS** to cover all bases ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=Reality%20can%20eliminate%20server%20tls,eliminate%20client%20tls%20fingerprint%20characteristics)). If using REALITY, be prepared with strategies to manage IP blocks (see §5).
  - **Usage:** Choose a reputable **camouflage domain** (SNI) – something common in China (e.g. a major cloud or content provider). Configure Xray server with REALITY keys (X25519 keypair) and set the `serverName` to the fake domain and its known public key (from the real server’s cert) ([Xray with Reality+ Vision+ uTLS. Use your own proxy/ VPN and get rid of… | by j3ffyang | Medium](https://j3ffyang.medium.com/xray-with-reality-vision-utls-3abfb63b682e#:~:text=,validation%20to%20proceed%20with%20communication)). The client needs matching settings and will verify the server’s presented handshake against the expected public key (to avoid MITM). Since REALITY is complex, follow an updated tutorial for config syntax ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=Xray,REALITY)) ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=v2rayN%20version%206,and%20removes%20legacy%20XTLS%20settings)).

**Summary of Transports:** For **max performance (if you can handle your own IP)**, go with **VLESS over TCP + REALITY + XTLS-Vision**, which gives the fastest, most covert channel ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=Reality%20can%20eliminate%20server%20tls,eliminate%20client%20tls%20fingerprint%20characteristics)). If you need to **rely on a CDN** to avoid IP blocks or to improve last-mile latency, use **VLESS or Trojan over TLS with WS or gRPC**, and apply obfuscation tricks (uTLS, plausible request patterns). In practice, many deploy **multiple** transports for redundancy – e.g. one server entry with VLESS+REALITY (direct) and another with VLESS+WS+TLS (via Cloudflare) – so if one method fails, the other might work.

## 3. TLS Fingerprinting and Obfuscation Techniques

China’s DPI systems have become adept at distinguishing proxy tools by subtle TLS fingerprint differences and traffic behavior. Modern Xray setups therefore use several **obfuscation techniques** to blend in with normal traffic:

- **uTLS (TLS Fingerprint Camouflage):** Xray integrates the uTLS library which can imitate the TLS handshake of popular browsers. This addresses the problem that Go’s default TLS stack has a fingerprint that became known to censors.
  - You can configure the **`fingerprint`** in Xray (client side) to simulate Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc., or even generate random popular fingerprints ([Transport | Project X](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/transport.html#:~:text=,types%20of%20options%20are%20supported)) ([Transport | Project X](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/transport.html#:~:text=%2A%20%60,qq)). By doing so, the ClientHello and cipher suite order will match a real browser. **This is highly recommended** – as one dev noted, using uTLS significantly “helps ease” the blocking of protocols ([Detected? · Issue #659 · trojan-gfw/trojan · GitHub](https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan/issues/659#:~:text=Loading)). In fact, **Chinese users found using uTLS was necessary after late 2022** for protocols like Trojan to survive ([Detected? · Issue #659 · trojan-gfw/trojan · GitHub](https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan/issues/659#:~:text=Loading)).
  - Most Xray clients (v2rayN, v2rayNG, etc.) have a UI option for *“TLS fingerprint”*. Set it to a common value (e.g. `chrome`). This way your proxy TLS handshake is indistinguishable from a normal Chrome browser hitting the same SNI. *Example:* one might simulate a Chrome on Windows TLS handshake to `login.microsoft.com` – nothing unusual there to an ISP.
  - **Evidence:** NaiveProxy, which literally uses Chrome’s network stack, remained unblocked in the 2022 crackdown – supporting the view that TLS fingerprinting was a key factor ([Large scale blocking of TLS-based censorship circumvention tools in China · Issue #129 · net4people/bbs · GitHub](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/129#:~:text=fortuna%20%20%20commented%20,98)). Xray’s uTLS gives us the same stealth advantage without using Chrome directly.

- **XTLS Vision (Eliminate TLS-in-TLS signature):** As mentioned, Vision mode removes the telltale signs of a proxy protocol running *inside* TLS. Without Vision, a TLS-based proxy might have two TLS layers (the outer HTTPS and an inner VMess encryption) or unusual packet sizes due to double encryption. Vision ensures after the handshake, the data flow looks like one layer. This prevents DPI from noticing, for example, that the payload of your TLS stream isn’t typical HTTPS traffic. It’s an important obfuscation on the **data phase** of the connection ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=Reality%20can%20eliminate%20server%20tls,eliminate%20client%20tls%20fingerprint%20characteristics)).
  - **Note:** Vision (and earlier XTLS) required both client and server support (use Xray core on both ends). As of 2023, mainstream clients support it, and Xray’s reality implementation actually mandates using Vision (REALITY only works in Xray with VLESS+Vision, encryption set to `none`). The client just needs to enable the same `flow: xtls-rprx-vision`. New versions of v2rayN/NG have removed legacy XTLS and automatically use Vision or REALITY modes ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=v2rayN%20version%206,and%20removes%20legacy%20XTLS%20settings)).

- **TLS Handshake Fragmentation:** A lesser-known trick to foil censorship is to **fragment the TLS handshake packets**. Xray 1.8.3+ introduced a `fragment` option for outbounds (and sing-box has similar) ([how to use fragment in xray core? · Issue #2392 · XTLS/Xray-core · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/issues/2392#:~:text=Loading)) ([how to use fragment in xray core? · Issue #2392 · XTLS/Xray-core · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/issues/2392#:~:text=Loading)). This can break the ClientHello into multiple small TCP packets, making it harder for DPI systems to match a fingerprint or perform active probing (since the handshake isn’t received in one piece). Chinese users haven’t widely needed this yet, but it proved useful in Iran (where even Cloudflare fronting was blocked until handshake fragmentation was used) ([how to use fragment in xray core? · Issue #2392 · XTLS/Xray-core · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/issues/2392#:~:text=,can%20be%20configured%20as%20follows)). In Xray config, one can set for example:
  ```json
  "outbounds": [{
      ...,
      "streamSettings": {
         "security": "tls",
         "tlsSettings": {
            "serverName": "your.domain.com",
            "fingerprint": "chrome"
         }
      },
      "sockopt": { "dialerProxy": "fragment", "mark": 255 }
  },
  {
      "tag": "fragment",
      "protocol": "freedom",
      "settings": {
         "fragment": {
            "packets": "tlshello",
            "length": "100-200",
            "interval": "10-20"
         }
      }
  }]
  ```
  This obscure setting is usually not needed unless your specific ISP is doing aggressive active probing. Use only if you find that even normal TLS handshakes to allowed domains are getting mysteriously dropped.

- **Domain and SNI Choices:** If not using REALITY (which sidesteps SNI issues by using whitelisted ones), be **strategic in domain selection**:
  - Use a **fully qualified domain** that you control and get a legitimate certificate (Let’s Encrypt or others). The domain should ideally host some innocuous content. Avoid obvious “tech” names or domains associated with known VPN sites. Many users go with generic or random names, or subdomains of a reputable domain.
  - Some practitioners choose domains that resemble CDNs or common services. However, avoid using truly high-profile domains that you don’t own in a normal TLS mode (that would fail cert verification). For example, don’t set your SNI to `www.baidu.com` unless you are actually terminating TLS on a Baidu certificate! (REALITY can do such a thing safely, but standard TLS cannot).
  - If using Cloudflare or similar CDN, you **must** use a domain that is on that CDN (orange-clouded in Cloudflare’s DNS). The SNI will be your domain and the CDN will present its certificate. This is fine as long as the domain isn’t blocked. Generally, **CDN-proxied custom domains are not blocked by SNI in China** because that would collateral-damage real sites. Just ensure DNS for that domain is only resolved via trusted DNS (to avoid DNS poisoning).
  - Consider enabling **ESNI/ECH** only if you know what you’re doing. At present, Encrypted Client Hello is not widely deployed and GFW is likely blocking unknown TLS extensions. It’s safer to assume SNI is visible and choose it wisely, rather than rely on ECH.

- **Camouflage Web Content (Fallbacks):** To truly **mimic normal traffic**, it’s critical that if a censoring entity *actively connects* to your server, it sees a normal website or service:
  - **Fallback page:** Xray allows configuring a fallback on the entry port. For instance, with VLESS/Trojan over XTLS or TLS, you can specify that any unknown data (or HTTP request) on port 443 gets forwarded to a local webserver or served a static page. **Always enable a fallback**. Many one-click scripts deploy a default “Welcome to Xray” page – **do NOT leave the default**, as it’s easily recognized ([Large scale blocking of TLS-based censorship circumvention tools in China · Issue #129 · net4people/bbs · GitHub](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/129#:~:text=jumping%20programs%20will%20place%20a,can%20be%20completely%20manually%20recognized)). Replace it with a believable site (could be a simple blog homepage or an error page).
  - If using Trojan, you might run an Nginx on the same port to handle normal HTTPS requests and pass through Trojan traffic via SNI routing. Ensure that an HTTP GET to your domain returns something convincing (even a 302 redirect to a real site or a generic HTML is better than a TCP reset).
  - **Active probing:** GFW often will try to connect to your IP on port 443 without the proper protocol, to see if it responds oddly. For example, it might send a simple TLS ClientHello with an SNI of your domain. If your server immediately closes the connection (because it expected a proxy handshake), they know it’s not a standard webserver. By having an actual TLS web service (or Xray’s fallback) that can complete a handshake and respond, you reduce the chance of easy detection. One user noted their Trojan with fallback still only handled HTTP (not HTTPS) on the fallback and worried it would get blocked soon ([Large scale blocking of TLS-based censorship circumvention tools in China · Issue #129 · net4people/bbs · GitHub](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/129#:~:text=,443%20at%20the%20same%20time)). The safer approach is to allow the fallback to complete a full TLS exchange (serve an HTTPS page) so that even a TLS probe looks normal.
  - **Stealth on IP:** If possible, configure the server to **reject unknown SNI** (only allow your domain’s SNI). This way, random Hello with other SNI are dropped. Xray’s `rejectUnknownSni` can enforce this ([Transport | Project X](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/transport.html#:~:text=)). It’s another layer to avoid reflecting anything unusual if probed with wrong hostnames.

In summary, **mimic everything about regular traffic**: the TLS handshake fingerprint (uTLS), the data flow (Vision and proper TLS usage), and the service behavior (fallback web content). These obfuscation tactics combined make it extremely difficult for censors to distinguish your proxy from millions of legitimate HTTPS connections.

## 4. Server Location, Network and Domain Considerations

Even a perfectly camouflaged proxy will perform poorly if the server’s network is suboptimal for China or easily blacklisted. Key considerations for **server setup in or around China:**

- **Server Region & ISP Routing:** China’s international bandwidth is limited and certain routes are far better:
  - **Hong Kong & Singapore:** Closest to mainland and often lower latency. Hong Kong in particular is a favorite (latency <50ms in South China). **CN2 GIA routes** from HK to China Telecom are the gold standard for reliability and speed ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=International%20lines%20out%20of%20China,Ctrl%2Bf%29%20for%20CN2%20GIA)). Many providers offer “China optimized” plans using premium transit (e.g. BandwagonHost/搬瓦工 has CN2 GIA VPS in HK and Los Angeles ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=IPLC%2FIEPL,Ctrl%2Bf%29%20for%20CN2%20GIA))). These are expensive but high quality. Singapore has good connectivity to China Unicom/CT too, and is slightly cheaper.
  - **US West (Los Angeles/San Jose):** Common for reaching North China. If the provider has **CN2** or **CMI** peering, performance can be decent. A CN2 GIA in LA can outperform a non-CN2 in HK in stability, ironically, and is more affordable ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=IPLC%2FIEPL,Ctrl%2Bf%29%20for%20CN2%20GIA)). Expect ~130-180ms latency to China. Avoid US East or Europe servers for real-time use (latency 200ms+ plus congestion).
  - **Japan, Taiwan, Korea:** These are geographically close, but quality varies. Japan has many VPS options but some have unstable routes (packet loss via certain undersea cables). Still, a good Japan link can be ~80ms to Shanghai/Beijing. Korea is close but often routed poorly to China (traffic might go through Japan anyway).
  - **Within Mainland China?** Hosting a proxy inside China defeats the purpose (it would be subject to local ISP filters and legal risk). One exception is using an **IPLC/IEPL** (private leased line) which is essentially an inside-mainland endpoint directly connected outside – but that’s enterprise-level (very costly) ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=International%20lines%20out%20of%20China,Ctrl%2Bf%29%20for%20CN2%20GIA)). Some advanced users rent an IPLC relay to guarantee throughput, but most will stick to nearby offshore servers.
  - **Cloud Providers:** Big cloud companies like **Aliyun (Alibaba Cloud)** or Tencent Cloud have “CN2” enabled plans out of HK or Singapore and are known to perform well ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=CN2%20GIA)). Vultr and AWS Lightsail have Singapore/Japan locations accessible in China (though not CN2, sometimes decent). Just note that big cloud IP ranges might be more on GFW radar. Smaller VPS providers sometimes fly under the radar until abuse occurs.

- **IP Persistence and Replacement:** **Expect IPs to get blocked eventually.** GFW maintains blacklists of IPs known for proxy/VPN. If you rent a popular provider’s VM, there’s a chance your IP was used by someone else and already blocked (test it first). Choose providers that offer **easy IP change** or have many IPs. Before signup, *“ask if you can change IP whenever necessary”* ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=Since%20IP%20addresses%20frequently%20get,server%E2%80%99s%20IP%20address%20whenever%20necessary)) – some hosts allow one free change or a small fee for a new IP.
  - Keep some backup IPs or servers ready. For mission-critical use (e.g. family or a small business needing always-on access), having a second VPS in a different region as standby is wise. You can add both to your client and if one is unreachable, use the other.

- **Domain Name Strategy:** If you are not using REALITY (which removes the need for your own domain), you will register a domain:
  - Use a reputable registrar (avoid .cn TLD or anything that requires real-name in China). Common TLDs like .com, .net, .org are fine. Some users prefer obscure TLDs, but there’s no strong evidence GFW treats them differently. What *does* matter is how you use the domain.
  - **DNS hosting:** Consider hosting DNS with a global provider (Cloudflare DNS (not proxy), Quad9, etc.) that has servers worldwide. Chinese DNS queries might be poisoned if the domain is deemed sensitive. Using DoT/DoH on client side can mitigate DNS poisoning. You can also set up DNS to serve **China a different IP** (a technique with DNSPod’s split horizon, if you had an inside-China decoy) – but that’s advanced and usually not needed.
  - If you are using a CDN, just CNAME your domain to the CDN and enable proxy. This hides your origin IP from the public DNS. If not using CDN, **never expose your real IP in public records** more than necessary. Some people use a placeholder origin and only give the actual IP via out-of-band means (though practically GFW will find the IP once traffic starts).
  - For REALITY users: indeed you **“do not need a domain name or DNS records”** at all ([Xray REALITY tutorial | cscot](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/03/02/Xray-REALITY-tutorial/#:~:text=Since%20IP%20addresses%20frequently%20get,server%E2%80%99s%20IP%20address%20whenever%20necessary)). This simplifies setup and avoids any DNS-based blocking. The SNI you impersonate is unrelated to your server’s address.

- **TLS Certificates:** Use Let’s Encrypt or another widely trusted CA if deploying TLS. This ensures Chinese browsers/devices trust the cert. **Do not use self-signed certs** (except in REALITY where the client expects it). A self-signed will trigger errors and could be a giveaway if an active probe sees a non-browser-trusted cert. LE certificates are free and easy; automate their renewal.
  - Some have had success using **Cloudflare Origin Certificate** (a free cert signed by Cloudflare, valid for your domain, but only trusted by Cloudflare). This is fine *only* if all clients connect via the Cloudflare proxy – any direct hit with that cert would appear untrusted. So LE is generally safer to cover both direct and CDN scenarios.

- **Bandwidth and Performance:** Look for servers with solid bandwidth to China. Metrics like **routing** (CN2, etc.), **packet loss**, and **latency stability** matter more than raw speed. A 100 Mbps CN2 link will beat a 1 Gbps generic link that has 10% packet loss to China. Many community forums share “China network quality” of VPS providers. Providers often advertised as “亚洲优化” (Asia optimized) or with “直连” (direct route) are preferred.
  - Enable **BBR congestion control** on your Linux VPS (or BBR plus variants). This can significantly improve throughput on high-latency links. Most one-click Xray scripts or tutorials include enabling BBR because it helps utilize bandwidth fully.
  - Also consider **CPU** if using heavy protocols: XTLS/VLESS are light on CPU, but if you fallback to something like OpenVPN, it will eat CPU at high speeds. For most Xray usage, a 1 vCPU with AES-NI is sufficient for hundreds of Mbps.

- **Server Firewall:** Implement basic firewall rules:
  - Allow only necessary ports (e.g. 22 for SSH, 80/443 for web/proxy). **Close everything else** to reduce attack surface and scanning noise.
  - If using CDN exclusively, you can firewall to only allow the CDN IP ranges on 443. This way any direct connection (like GFW probing your IP) will be dropped. *Note:* if you do this, you cannot use direct proxy as backup unless you adjust firewall. So this is for a strictly CDN-tunneled setup.
  - Use fail2ban or similar to ban IPs that hammer your SSH or make obvious malicious requests. This doesn’t directly stop GFW, but keeps other attackers away and prevents unnecessary attention (and load).

## 5. System Hardening and Failover Strategies

To ensure **long-term accessibility**, you should harden your Xray deployment and have contingency plans:

- **Keep Xray Updated:** The arms race with GFW continues. Xray (Project X) is actively maintained with new features and fixes. For example, REALITY and Vision were introduced specifically to counter new blocking methods ([How does XTLS REALITY break through the whitelist? REALITY source code analysis - ObjShadow's Blog](https://objshadow.pages.dev/en/posts/how-reality-works/#:~:text=Since%20some%20areas%20in%20mainland,unavailable%20in%20these%20areas%20overnight)) ([How does XTLS REALITY break through the whitelist? REALITY source code analysis - ObjShadow's Blog](https://objshadow.pages.dev/en/posts/how-reality-works/#:~:text=Since%20some%20areas%20in%20mainland,unavailable%20in%20these%20areas%20overnight)). Stay on the latest stable release to benefit from improvements. Subscribe to project news or community forums for any breaking changes (e.g., a new censorship method might require tweaking config or adding a plugin).

- **Multi-Protocol/Multi-Server Setup:** Don’t put all eggs in one basket:
  - Consider running **multiple inbound protocols** on your server – e.g. a Trojan listener on port 443 and a separate VLESS+REALITY on 8443 (with a different domain or no domain). If one is blocked or slowed, the other might work. Xray’s flexibility allows multiple inbounds in one instance.
  - Alternatively, have two servers in different regions/providers: one primary, one backup. Your client (e.g. Clash or v2rayN) can merge their subscriptions and you can manually switch if needed. Some advanced setups use load-balancing or health-checking to auto-switch nodes (Clash Pro can do this).
  - If affordability is a concern, the backup can be a cheaper VM or one with a less optimal route – at least you won’t be completely cut off if the main goes down.

- **Automated Failover:** If you self-manage and have the skills, you can script some failover:
  - Use a monitoring service (or a simple script from outside China) to periodically check your proxy’s reachability from China (sites like ipip.net or ping.pe can test from within China). If down, trigger a DNS update to point your domain to a backup server or IP. Keep DNS TTL low (e.g. 5 minutes) for quick propagation.
  - Dynamic DNS can be leveraged if your IP changes frequently (though most VPS have static IP).
  - There are also user-made **“IP auto-switch” scripts** that cycle through a list of Cloudflare CDN IPs or different domain fronts to find one that works fastest ([Cloudflare优选IP、自动选择最快节点教程 - mack-a](https://www.v2ray-agent.com/archives/1684858575649#:~:text=Cloudflare%E4%BC%98%E9%80%89IP%E3%80%81%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A8%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E6%9C%80%E5%BF%AB%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B%20,%C2%B7%20%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E6%AD%A5%EF%BC%8C%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0CDN%E5%9C%B0%E5%9D%80%E3%80%82%20%C2%B7%20%E7%AC%AC%E5%9B%9B%E6%AD%A5%EF%BC%8C%E6%8B%89%E5%8F%96%E8%AE%A2%E9%98%85%E5%9C%B0%E5%9D%80%E5%88%B0%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0)) ([Cloudflare优选IP、自动选择最快节点教程 - mack-a](https://www.v2ray-agent.com/archives/1684858575649#:~:text=%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%AD%A5%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8B%E8%BD%BD%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E4%BC%98%E9%80%89IP%E3%80%82%20%C2%B7%20%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E6%AD%A5%EF%BC%8C%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81CDN%E7%9A%84%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE%EF%BC%88ws%E3%80%81gRPC%E3%80%81HTTPUpgrade%EF%BC%88%E6%8E%A8%E8%8D%90%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%89%E3%80%82%20%C2%B7%20%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E6%AD%A5%EF%BC%8C%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0CDN%E5%9C%B0%E5%9D%80%E3%80%82,%C2%B7%20%E7%AC%AC%E5%9B%9B%E6%AD%A5%EF%BC%8C%E6%8B%89%E5%8F%96%E8%AE%A2%E9%98%85%E5%9C%B0%E5%9D%80%E5%88%B0%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0)). Some Chinese users integrate those with Xray (especially for WS+CDN setups) to always get the best routing. This improves stability and performance over time.

- **Camouflage & Anti-Detection Hardening:** Beyond initial setup, continuously ensure your node does not stick out:
  - **Avoid traffic spikes** that could draw attention. If you stream 4K video 24/7 through your proxy, a local ISP might notice that the IP is serving a tremendous, constant encrypted stream. Try to mimic normal user behavior (which has peaks and idle times). For shared nodes (if you share with friends/family), enforce rate limits or at least monitor usage.
  - **Name your server innocuously.** Sometimes the server’s reverse DNS or hostname might leak. Use something generic if possible. It’s a minor point, but every bit helps (e.g. don’t name it “vpnserver.mydomain”).
  - **Time and content shaping:** Some have suggested adding random padding or delays to make traffic patterns closer to real HTTPS (which has bursts, not constant). Xray’s vision already adds some random padding in handshakes ([VLESS - Project X](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/outbounds/vless.html#:~:text=VLESS%20,vision)). If you are extremely cautious, you could proxy some *real* web browsing through the same node so that it fetches actual webpages in between (though this is uncommon).
  - **ShadowTLS or Fronting Proxy:** In areas with SNI whitelisting, another approach is using **ShadowTLS** v2/v3 as a front (which acts as a pure TLS passthrough for allowed SNIs, wrapping your Xray inside). REALITY largely obviates this, but ShadowTLS is an alternative that some Chinese operators use in front of Xray, so the GFW only sees a pure TLS to (say) a allowed domain and ShadowTLS forwards the raw payload to Xray. This is a complex setup but worth noting if the environment gets more hostile.

- **Human factor:** Ensure **client devices** are also secured. Sometimes the weakest link is not the proxy at all – it could be a misconfigured client leaking DNS or a user visiting a blocked site without the proxy by accident. Use client apps (Clash, v2rayN, etc.) that support routing rules: e.g. direct all foreign sites via proxy, and Chinese sites direct to avoid unnecessary load. This prevents accidental direct connections to Google that alert the ISP. Most clients have a “geosite:cn” routing to bypass proxy for Chinese domains, and “geoip:cn” to not proxy domestic IPs.
  - Also explain to users (if you share the proxy) basic opsec: don’t mention the proxy openly, don’t do extremely sensitive things that might trigger targeted surveillance, etc. While not a technical config issue, **staying under the radar** in usage patterns is part of “long-term accessibility”.

- **Case: Trojan vs VLESS fallback** – Community experiences:
  - Some users who had Trojan servers saw **immediate blocks unless behind CDN or using uTLS** ([Detected? · Issue #659 · trojan-gfw/trojan · GitHub](https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan/issues/659#:~:text=Leetroch%20%20%20commented%20,72)). Those who switched to **VLESS+XTLS+REALITY** report much better success, since it’s virtually indistinguishable from regular traffic when configured properly ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=Reality%20can%20eliminate%20server%20tls,eliminate%20client%20tls%20fingerprint%20characteristics)). In July 2024, forum members flatly recommend VLESS+REALITY+Vision as the go-to solution ([Need to bypass chinese firewall — LowEndTalk](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/196208/need-to-bypass-chinese-firewall#:~:text=Image%3A%20FranzkafkaFranzkafka%20%20Member)).
  - The takeaway: adapt with the community. If new GFW tactics arise (for example, if they start doing active full TLS MITM for certain traffic), the community will usually find a workaround (like requiring a state-issued root certificate would be one dystopian scenario; in that case, one might pivot to other methods like Hysteria UDP tunnels or even DNS over HTTPS tunnels, etc.). Keep an eye on forums like Linux.do or telegram groups for China users – they often share what’s currently working or not.

In conclusion, the **best Xray configuration for China** today is one that **mimics normal HTTPS to the fullest extent**: using **VLESS with REALITY over XTLS-Vision** (covering protocol, server and data camouflage) and **uTLS** for client camouflage – this combination has been explicitly cited as the most secure and resistant setup against the GFW ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=Reality%20can%20eliminate%20server%20tls,eliminate%20client%20tls%20fingerprint%20characteristics)). It foregoes CDN usage, so ensure a quality network path (CN2 or similar) and have contingencies for IP blocks. If a direct approach is not feasible, the next best is **VLESS (or Trojan) over TLS** with WebSocket or gRPC, fronted by a CDN, combined with uTLS and a convincing fallback site. 

By carefully applying the above strategies – from protocol selection and transport tuning to TLS fingerprinting, server placement, and fail-safes – you can achieve a fast, stable Xray proxy that **effectively bypasses Chinese censorship** while minimizing the risk of detection or disruption. The Great Firewall is formidable, but with an optimal configuration, you can stay one step ahead ([Vision and Reality, Which? · XTLS Xray-core · Discussion #2166 · GitHub](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/2166#:~:text=Reality%20can%20eliminate%20server%20tls,eliminate%20client%20tls%20fingerprint%20characteristics)) and enjoy open internet access with confidence.
