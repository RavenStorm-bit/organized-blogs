I’ll get back to you shortly with a detailed overview.

# The New Yorker’s Notable and Controversial Publications Since 2000

The New Yorker magazine has produced a vast array of influential journalism, commentary, fiction, and satire over the past two decades. Some articles have been **widely praised and impactful**, earning awards and shaping public discourse, while others have proven **controversial**, sparking backlash or debate. Below is an analysis of key pieces in each category, with titles, authors, publication dates, and summaries of their content and significance.

## Notable Publications

### “Torture at Abu Ghraib” – Seymour M. Hersh (May 10, 2004)  
In April 2004, The New Yorker published Seymour Hersh’s exposé “Torture at Abu Ghraib,” which revealed horrific abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. soldiers ([Ten Years of Abu Ghraib | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ten-years-of-abu-ghraib#:~:text=On%20April%2030%2C%202004%2C%20a,more%20images%2C%20and%20something%20else)). Hersh obtained a secret 53-page Army report by Major General Antonio Taguba, whose findings about “sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses” in the prison pointed to serious **institutional failures** ([Ten Years of Abu Ghraib | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ten-years-of-abu-ghraib#:~:text=soldiers%20abusing%20prisoners%20in%20Iraq%2C,more%20images%2C%20and%20something%20else)). Appearing just after CBS aired the first photos of abuses, Hersh’s report provided additional images and detailed evidence that abuse was **systematic**, not just rogue behavior ([Ten Years of Abu Ghraib | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ten-years-of-abu-ghraib#:~:text=On%20April%2030%2C%202004%2C%20a,more%20images%2C%20and%20something%20else)). The article caused international outrage, leading to military investigations and courts-martial of soldiers involved, and it put pressure on Pentagon and Bush Administration officials to account for policies that led to torture. Hersh’s piece was widely praised for its dogged investigative journalism and is credited with helping bring the Abu Ghraib scandal fully to light ([Ten Years of Abu Ghraib | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ten-years-of-abu-ghraib#:~:text=On%20April%2030%2C%202004%2C%20a,more%20images%2C%20and%20something%20else)).

### “The Cost Conundrum” – Atul Gawande (June 1, 2009)  
Surgeon and writer Atul Gawande’s **June 2009** article “The Cost Conundrum” examined why the small city of McAllen, Texas, had some of the **highest health-care costs** in the nation ([Obama’s Favorite New Yorker Article | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-favorite-new-yorker-article#:~:text=Today%E2%80%99s%20Times%20reports%20that%20President,a%20group%20of%20Democratic%20senators)) ([Obama’s Favorite New Yorker Article | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-favorite-new-yorker-article#:~:text=Gawande%E2%80%99s%20article%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Cost%20Conundrum%2C%E2%80%9D,problem%2C%20Gawande%20discovered%2C%20was%20overuse)). Gawande discovered that an “across-the-board overuse of medicine” – doctors ordering far more tests, scans, and procedures than in similar communities – was the primary driver of McAllen’s exorbitant Medicare spending ([Obama’s Favorite New Yorker Article | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-favorite-new-yorker-article#:~:text=better%20in%20most%20metrics%20of,problem%2C%20Gawande%20discovered%2C%20was%20overuse)). The piece gained enormous attention in the heat of the U.S. health reform debate. President Barack **Obama was so struck by it that he made the article required reading in the Oval Office**, telling senators “This is what we’ve got to fix,” and used it to illustrate inefficiencies in the system ([Obama’s Favorite New Yorker Article | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-favorite-new-yorker-article#:~:text=Today%E2%80%99s%20Times%20reports%20that%20President,a%20group%20of%20Democratic%20senators)). Gawande’s lucid storytelling and analysis earned widespread praise; **health-policy experts and journalists cited the article** as a seminal explanation of why more care can sometimes result in worse outcomes ([Obama’s Favorite New Yorker Article | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-favorite-new-yorker-article#:~:text=Gawande%E2%80%99s%20article%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Cost%20Conundrum%2C%E2%80%9D,problem%2C%20Gawande%20discovered%2C%20was%20overuse)). “The Cost Conundrum” influenced the discourse around the Affordable Care Act and highlighted The New Yorker’s ability to inject nuanced journalism into policy discussions.

### “Covert Operations” – Jane Mayer (August 30, 2010)  
In August 2010, investigative reporter Jane Mayer published “Covert Operations: The Billionaire Brothers Who Are Waging a War Against Obama,” a deep dive into the **political influence of Charles and David Koch**. Mayer detailed how the Koch brothers had built an “**integrated political network**” of think tanks, advocacy groups, and funding vehicles to push a libertarian, pro-corporate agenda ([What Jane Mayer's Dark Money Misses About Today's Radical Right](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/jane-mayer-dark-money-review-koch-brothers-gop/#:~:text=expands%20on%20Mayer%E2%80%99s%20famous%20article%2C,expanding%20their%20House%20majority%20and)). The article revealed the vast scope of the Kochs’ secret spending – hundreds of millions of dollars – to block President Obama’s policies (like cap-and-trade climate legislation and health-care reform) and to bankroll the Tea Party movement and Republican candidates ([Five Myths About the Koch Brothers — And Why It Matters To Set Them Straight – BillMoyers.com](https://billmoyers.com/story/five-myths-about-the-koch-network-and-why-it-matters-to-set-them-straight/#:~:text=investigative%20reports%20started%20to%20appear,her%20recent%20book%2C%20Dark%20Money)) ([Five Myths About the Koch Brothers — And Why It Matters To Set Them Straight – BillMoyers.com](https://billmoyers.com/story/five-myths-about-the-koch-network-and-why-it-matters-to-set-them-straight/#:~:text=One%20after%20another%2C%20meaty%20reports,its%20latest%20champion%2C%20President%20Obama)). “Covert Operations” was one of the first major pieces to make the Koch brothers household names, as previously their political philanthropy had been little-known ([Five Myths About the Koch Brothers — And Why It Matters To Set Them Straight – BillMoyers.com](https://billmoyers.com/story/five-myths-about-the-koch-network-and-why-it-matters-to-set-them-straight/#:~:text=Not%20long%20ago%2C%20many%20Americans%2C,her%20recent%20book%2C%20Dark%20Money)). The piece was **widely acclaimed** for shining a light on “dark money” in American politics, and it had a significant impact: it catalyzed further media scrutiny of the Kochs ([Five Myths About the Koch Brothers — And Why It Matters To Set Them Straight – BillMoyers.com](https://billmoyers.com/story/five-myths-about-the-koch-network-and-why-it-matters-to-set-them-straight/#:~:text=Not%20long%20ago%2C%20many%20Americans%2C,her%20recent%20book%2C%20Dark%20Money)), and Mayer later expanded the reporting into her award-winning 2016 book *Dark Money* ([What Jane Mayer's Dark Money Misses About Today's Radical Right](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/jane-mayer-dark-money-review-koch-brothers-gop/#:~:text=Dark%20Money%20by%20investigative%20journalist,led%20plutocrats)). This article is often cited as **“famous”** in the annals of political journalism for exposing how a few wealthy individuals quietly shaped U.S. politics on a grand scale ([Five Myths About the Koch Brothers — And Why It Matters To Set Them Straight – BillMoyers.com](https://billmoyers.com/story/five-myths-about-the-koch-network-and-why-it-matters-to-set-them-straight/#:~:text=Not%20long%20ago%2C%20many%20Americans%2C,her%20recent%20book%2C%20Dark%20Money)).

### “From Aggressive Overtures to Sexual Assault: Harvey Weinstein’s Accusers Tell Their Stories” – Ronan Farrow (October 10, 2017)  
In October 2017, Ronan Farrow’s bombshell report on Harvey Weinstein detailed a pattern of **sexual harassment and assault** allegations against the Hollywood producer spanning decades ([Ronan Farrow on investigating Harvey Weinstein: ‘When family issues are thrown at me, it’s a dirty move’ | Ronan Farrow | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/12/ronan-farrow-on-investigating-harvey-weinstein-family-issues-thrown-at-me-is-a-dirty-move#:~:text=is%20a%20large%20portion%20devoted,%E2%80%9D)). Farrow’s article (published on the New Yorker website’s *News Desk* as the first of several pieces) included on-the-record accounts from multiple women who described Weinstein’s predatory behavior, along with an audio recording of Weinstein admitting to groping a model – evidence previously swept under the rug ([Ronan Farrow talks Weinstein investigation, #MeToo movement and new book at Chicago Ideas Week - Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-and-culture/2019/10/18/20920938/ronan-farrow-metoo-harvey-weinstein-gretchen-carlson#:~:text=Actress%20Rose%20McGowan%2C%20one%20of,ensuing%20explosive%20story%2C%20Farrow%20explained)) ([Ronan Farrow talks Weinstein investigation, #MeToo movement and new book at Chicago Ideas Week - Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-and-culture/2019/10/18/20920938/ronan-farrow-metoo-harvey-weinstein-gretchen-carlson#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20approached%20Rose%20and%20very,%E2%80%9D)). The investigation had an immediate and profound cultural impact: it helped ignite the **#MeToo movement**, as women worldwide began coming forward with their own stories of sexual abuse. Within days, Weinstein was fired from his company; within weeks, he was under criminal investigation. (He would be convicted in 2020 of sex crimes in New York.) Farrow’s work, alongside parallel reporting by *The New York Times*, earned the 2018 **Pulitzer Prize for Public Service** for exposing powerful abusers ([Ronan Farrow talks Weinstein investigation, #MeToo movement and new book at Chicago Ideas Week - Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-and-culture/2019/10/18/20920938/ronan-farrow-metoo-harvey-weinstein-gretchen-carlson#:~:text=Farrow%20along%20with%20New%20York,%E2%80%9D)). The article was lauded for its meticulous fact-gathering and moral courage – Farrow had persisted despite intimidation and legal threats ([Ronan Farrow on investigating Harvey Weinstein: ‘When family issues are thrown at me, it’s a dirty move’ | Ronan Farrow | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/12/ronan-farrow-on-investigating-harvey-weinstein-family-issues-thrown-at-me-is-a-dirty-move#:~:text=is%20a%20large%20portion%20devoted,%E2%80%9D)). It also set off industry-wide fallout: other figures in media, politics, and entertainment were accused and removed, signaling a broad reckoning with sexual misconduct.

### “Cat Person” – Kristen Roupenian (December 11, 2017)  
Not all influential New Yorker pieces have been journalism – one of the most **culturally viral** pieces was a short story. Kristen Roupenian’s fiction piece “Cat Person,” published in December 2017, became an **internet sensation** virtually overnight ([Cat Person - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Person#:~:text=,day%20dating%22.%5B%203)). The story, about a brief, uncomfortable romance between a 20-year-old college woman and an older man, struck a chord for its frank exploration of modern dating dynamics, consent, and miscommunication. It was shared millions of times; the BBC noted it was being discussed widely online for how relatable it was to many women’s experiences ([Cat Person - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Person#:~:text=,day%20dating%22.%5B%203)). “Cat Person” was arguably the first short story to ever **go viral** on social media in this way. It sparked extensive think-pieces and conversations about dating in the digital age, “gray areas” in sexual encounters, and the power of fiction to illuminate social truths. The New Yorker’s fiction editor Deborah Treisman remarked on how unprecedented the response was, and Roupenian said she was stunned by the scale of the reaction ([What It Felt Like When “Cat Person” Went Viral | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-it-felt-like-when-cat-person-went-viral#:~:text=What%20It%20Felt%20Like%20When,Yorker%2C%20in%20December%2C%202017%2C)). The story’s popularity even led to a film adaptation in 2023. “Cat Person” demonstrated The New Yorker’s continued relevance in publishing fiction that can have as much real-world impact as a reported article, and it spurred debates on the nuances of consent and gender expectations among a broad readership that might not typically engage with literary short stories.

### “Guantánamo’s Darkest Secret” – Ben Taub (April 15, 2019)  
Ben Taub’s “Guantánamo’s Darkest Secret,” published in April 2019, was a powerful piece of narrative reporting that brought new attention to the human aftermath of America’s War on Terror. Taub focused on the story of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a Mauritanian man who was **imprisoned without charge at Guantánamo Bay for 14 years** and brutally tortured under U.S. authority, and on Steve Wood, one of his former guards who became Slahi’s friend ([Ben Taub on “Guantánamo's Darkest Secret”](https://ket.org/program/amanpour-and-company/ben-taub-on-guantanamo-s-darkest-secret/#:~:text=Ben%20Taub%20on%20%E2%80%9CGuant%C3%A1namo%27s%20Darkest,Season%202019%20Episode%20276)). The article detailed how Slahi’s **false confession** (extracted through torture) ruined years of his life, and examined the psychological toll on both the prisoner and the guard – illustrating the “lasting effects” of American abuses on everyone involved ([Ben Taub Latest Articles | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/ben-taub#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20he%20won%20the,American%20abuses%20in%20Guant%C3%A1namo)). Taub’s reporting was notable for its depth of detail and empathy; he obtained personal diaries, interrogation records, and conducted extensive interviews to paint a full picture of Guantánamo’s legacy. The piece was **widely praised** as one of the most definitive accounts of a post-9/11 detainee’s ordeal. It won Taub the 2020 **Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing** ([Ben Taub Latest Articles | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/ben-taub#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20he%20won%20the,American%20abuses%20in%20Guant%C3%A1namo)). In the wake of publication, the story prompted renewed discussions about the continued detention of men at Guantánamo and calls for justice for those wrongfully held. *The New Yorker*’s commitment to long-form journalism paid off with this article, which combined investigative rigor with humanizing storytelling to illuminate a dark chapter of U.S. history.

### “The Plague Year” – Lawrence Wright (January 4, 2021)  
At the end of 2020, *The New Yorker* devoted an entire issue to “The Plague Year,” a sweeping 30,000-word report by Lawrence Wright that chronicled **America’s experience of the COVID-19 pandemic**. Published in January 2021, Wright’s article examined the **missteps, miscommunications, and scientific struggles** that defined the year 2020 in the U.S. ([The Plague Year - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plague_Year#:~:text=The%20book%20is%20written%20by,19%20pandemes.%5B%203)). It detailed early warnings that went unheeded, the chaos inside the Trump administration’s pandemic response, the race to develop vaccines, and the personal stories of doctors, patients, and public health officials. The piece offered a definitive timeline of how a country that “led the world in wealth, science, medicine, and preparedness” still **“endured more pain, disruption, and death than any other nation”** during COVID-19’s first year ([The Plague Year - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plague_Year#:~:text=the%20onset%20of%20the%20pandemic,4)). “The Plague Year” was widely praised for its comprehensiveness and clarity – effectively a first draft of history for the pandemic. Critics noted the article’s nuanced portraits of key figures and its indictment of failures at the highest levels. The piece was later expanded into a bestselling book by Wright ([The Plague Year - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plague_Year#:~:text=The%20book%20is%20written%20by,19%20pandemes.%5B%203)). As an example of notable New Yorker reporting, “The Plague Year” showed the magazine’s ability to synthesize complex, sprawling events into compelling narrative. It sparked conversation about governmental accountability and the lessons to be learned to avoid future public health catastrophes ([The Plague Year - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plague_Year#:~:text=Writing%20for%20the%20Israel%20Journal,4)).

*(The above are selected examples of notable New Yorker pieces. The magazine has earned numerous accolades, including at least **eight Pulitzer Prizes since 2014** for its reporting ([The New Yorker - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker#:~:text=According%20to%20a%202012%20Pew,10)), reflecting the impact of its journalism.)*

## Controversial Publications

###  (['New Yorker' Artist Shares His Cover Stories : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/20/558777025/im-just-trying-to-make-myself-laugh-new-yorker-artist-shares-his-cover-stories)) *The controversial July 21, 2008 *New Yorker* cover, “The Politics of Fear,” depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as extremist caricatures, which some critics argued could be misinterpreted as offensive rather than humorous.*  
**July 21, 2008 “Obama Cover” (Barry Blitt)** – This satirical cover illustration, titled **“The Politics of Fear,”** became one of *The New Yorker*’s most notorious images. Drawn by Barry Blitt during Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, it portrayed Obama in traditional Muslim attire and his wife Michelle dressed as a militant, fist-bumping in the Oval Office with a portrait of Osama bin Laden on the wall and an American flag burning in the fireplace ([The New Yorker - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker#:~:text=On%20July%2021%2C%202008%2C%20,67)). The cover was intended to mock the absurd **smear rumors** about the Obamas (suggesting Barack was a secret Muslim extremist, etc.), by exaggerating them to the point of absurdity ([The New Yorker - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker#:~:text=Many%20New%20Yorker%20readers%20saw,What%20we%20set%20out%20to)). However, the satire backfired for many. **Outrage ensued** as some readers – and even members of Obama’s and opponent John McCain’s campaigns – condemned the cover as offensive and potentially misleading ([The New Yorker - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker#:~:text=Many%20New%20Yorker%20readers%20saw,What%20we%20set%20out%20to)). They worried that people who didn’t get the joke would think *The New Yorker* itself was labeling the Obamas as terrorists. Editor David Remnick defended the cartoon as a bold satire of the “Politics of Fear” and “vicious and racist attacks” against the Obamas, saying the image’s **“obvious excesses”** should make its intent clear ([The New Yorker - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker#:~:text=cartoon%20whose%20irony%20could%20be,70)). Obama himself, while acknowledging the attempt at satire, said “I don’t think they were entirely successful” and noted that the imagery was insulting to Muslim Americans ([The New Yorker - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20on%20Larry,Americans%22.%5B%2071%20%5D%5B%2072)). The cover kicked off a national debate about the limits of political satire during a campaign. It remains one of The New Yorker’s most controversial moments, illustrating how even well-meaning satire can **spark backlash** when context and nuance collide with public perception.

### “Vengeance Is Ours” – Jared Diamond (April 21, 2008)  
In April 2008, *The New Yorker* ran an article titled “Annals of Anthropology: Vengeance Is Ours,” by Pulitzer-winning author Jared Diamond. The piece recounted a sensational tale of tribal warfare and revenge in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, as told to Diamond by a local man, Daniel Wemp, whom Diamond had met years earlier. According to the article, Wemp’s quest to avenge his uncle’s death in the 1990s led to a **three-year tribal war with 29 killings** and even left the target of his vengeance paralyzed in a wheelchair ([New Yorker Under Siege - Columbia Journalism Review](https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/new_yorker_under_siege.php#:~:text=,succeeded%20in%20discharging%20this%20responsibility)). The story, presented as factual, was shocking – and it soon **ignited controversy**. In 2009, two Papua New Guinean men (Wemp and the man described as his enemy) sued *The New Yorker* and Diamond for defamation, claiming the article was riddled with falsehoods and had wrongly accused them of crimes ([New Yorker Under Siege - Columbia Journalism Review](https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/new_yorker_under_siege.php#:~:text=First%2C%20some%20background.%20The%20%2410,but%20here%E2%80%99s%20a%20relevant%20passage)). The **$10 million lawsuit** alleged that Diamond’s account was not only incorrect but had potentially put lives in danger by attributing tribal killings to real individuals ([New Yorker Under Siege - Columbia Journalism Review](https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/new_yorker_under_siege.php#:~:text=First%2C%20some%20background.%20The%20%2410,but%20here%E2%80%99s%20a%20relevant%20passage)). Media watchdogs noted that several details in the story were **unverified and questionable**, raising “questions about how this particular article was cleared by the magazine’s venerable fact-checking department” ([New Yorker Under Siege - Columbia Journalism Review](https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/new_yorker_under_siege.php#:~:text=involving%20him%20and%20one%20of,checking%20department)). For instance, Diamond had relied on a single source (Wemp) for dramatic claims of violence that other reporting found dubious. *The New Yorker* eventually removed the article from its free website and the lawsuit was quietly dropped after a settlement, but the damage was done. The episode was an embarrassment for the magazine’s reputation for accuracy. It underscored the difficulties of vetting anecdotal stories from remote regions and became a case study in fact-checking lapses. “Vengeance Is Ours” remains a controversial publication that *The New Yorker*’s editors likely wish had received more scrutiny upfront.

### Brett Kavanaugh Allegation Article – Ronan Farrow & Jane Mayer (September 23, 2018)  
During the contentious confirmation battle of Supreme Court nominee **Brett Kavanaugh** in September 2018, *The New Yorker* published a explosive article by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer reporting a **new accusation of sexual misconduct**. The piece, titled “Senate Democrats Investigate a New Allegation of Sexual Misconduct from Kavanaugh’s College Years,” centered on Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who claimed that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her at a drunken dorm party in the 1980s ([Critics condemn New Yorker over uncorroborated Kavanaugh story: 'Lazy at best, slimy at worst' | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-condemn-new-yorker-over-uncorroborated-kavanaugh-story-lazy-at-best-slimy-at-worst#:~:text=The%20article%2C%20headlined%20%E2%80%9CSenate%20Democrats,during%20a%20Yale%20University%20party)) ([Critics condemn New Yorker over uncorroborated Kavanaugh story: 'Lazy at best, slimy at worst' | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-condemn-new-yorker-over-uncorroborated-kavanaugh-story-lazy-at-best-slimy-at-worst#:~:text=The%20article%2C%20headlined%20%E2%80%9CSenate%20Democrats,during%20a%20Yale%20University%20party)). Coming on the heels of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s separate allegation of assault, the Ramirez story intensified the firestorm around Kavanaugh. However, the *New Yorker*’s reporting itself quickly became a subject of controversy and **journalistic criticism**. The article acknowledged *within its own text* that Ramirez had **memory gaps** from the night (she’d been drinking) and that the reporters **could find no eyewitness to confirm Kavanaugh was even at the party in question** ([Critics condemn New Yorker over uncorroborated Kavanaugh story: 'Lazy at best, slimy at worst' | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-condemn-new-yorker-over-uncorroborated-kavanaugh-story-lazy-at-best-slimy-at-worst#:~:text=critics)). In fact, that crucial disclaimer – “Farrow and Mayer could not confirm… that Kavanaugh was present at the party” – was noted skeptically by other journalists, who felt the story was too thinly sourced to publish ([Critics condemn New Yorker over uncorroborated Kavanaugh story: 'Lazy at best, slimy at worst' | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-condemn-new-yorker-over-uncorroborated-kavanaugh-story-lazy-at-best-slimy-at-worst#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%27s%20worth%20noting%20that%20Ronan,Mediaite%20columnist%20Joseph%20Wulfsohn%20wrote)). A chorus of media critics, from a *National Review* editor to a *Mediaite* columnist, slammed the New Yorker piece as **“grossly irresponsible”** for airing an uncorroborated claim in such a high-stakes moment ([Critics condemn New Yorker over uncorroborated Kavanaugh story: 'Lazy at best, slimy at worst' | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-condemn-new-yorker-over-uncorroborated-kavanaugh-story-lazy-at-best-slimy-at-worst#:~:text=National%20Review%20editor%20Charles%20C,Yorker%20for%20publishing%20the%20story)). Even some who normally admired the reporters argued this report was *“not good journalism”*, given the lack of solid evidence and the reliance on decades-old recollections ([Critics condemn New Yorker over uncorroborated Kavanaugh story: 'Lazy at best, slimy at worst' | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-condemn-new-yorker-over-uncorroborated-kavanaugh-story-lazy-at-best-slimy-at-worst#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNew%20Yorker%20piece%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20even,corroboration%2C%20possible%20testimony%2C%E2%80%9D%20Bila%20wrote)). Conservative outlets accused the magazine of partisan bias, while others raised concerns that this could set a dangerous precedent for publishing accusations without sufficient verification. *The New Yorker* stood by the decision, arguing that Ramirez’s account was newsworthy and that corroborating witnesses (who heard about the incident second-hand) lent it credence. But the backlash was intense: the phrase “**The New Yorker story**” became a talking point for those defending Kavanaugh, who used it to paint the media as overzealous. In the end, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Court, but the episode fueled an ongoing debate about media standards in the #MeToo era – specifically, how to balance giving voice to survivors with the need for corroboration. The Farrow/Mayer piece remains a controversial example of these dilemmas.

### “The Case of Al Franken” – Jane Mayer (July 29, 2019)  
In July 2019, *The New Yorker* dove into the fraught territory of #MeToo backlash with Jane Mayer’s lengthy article “The Case of Al Franken.” In this piece, Mayer re-examined the circumstances that led to Democratic Senator Al Franken’s resignation in 2017 over allegations of sexual misconduct. The article was notable – and controversial – for its sympathetic stance toward Franken and its suggestion that he **was unfairly ousted without due process**. Mayer meticulously investigated Franken’s main accuser, radio host Leeann Tweeden, and found discrepancies in her account of a 2006 USO tour incident (the famous photograph of Franken miming groping a sleeping Tweeden) as well as political motivations behind how the story came out ([What regrets about a hasty, high-profile #MeToo resignation reveal | Laura Kipnis | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/al-franken-resignation-metoo#:~:text=So%20believes%20the%20masterful%20investigative,or%20so%20from%20her%20chest)) ([What regrets about a hasty, high-profile #MeToo resignation reveal | Laura Kipnis | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/al-franken-resignation-metoo#:~:text=Mayer%2C%20a%20dogged%20unearther%20of,see%20Barack%20Obama%E2%80%99s%20birth%20certificate)). In tweets promoting the piece, Mayer summed up her findings boldly: “Almost NOTHING His Main Accuser Said checks out” ([What regrets about a hasty, high-profile #MeToo resignation reveal | Laura Kipnis | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/al-franken-resignation-metoo#:~:text=So%20believes%20the%20masterful%20investigative,or%20so%20from%20her%20chest)). The article included interviews with **numerous colleagues and friends of Franken** who felt he had been railroaded, and it noted that several senators regretted urging him to resign so quickly ([What regrets about a hasty, high-profile #MeToo resignation reveal | Laura Kipnis | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/al-franken-resignation-metoo#:~:text=S%20hould%20Al%20Franken%20really,kinds%20of%20behavior%20is%20important%E2%80%9D)) ([What regrets about a hasty, high-profile #MeToo resignation reveal | Laura Kipnis | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/al-franken-resignation-metoo#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cdifferentiating%20different%20kinds%20of%20behavior,is%20important%E2%80%9D)). Publication of “The Case of Al Franken” set off **intense debate**. On one hand, Franken’s supporters and some commentators praised Mayer for bravely questioning a possibly hasty #MeToo judgment – arguing that not all offenses are equal and that Franken was a casualty of a feverish climate. On the other hand, many voices (especially women journalists and activists) criticized the piece as a tone-deaf “revisionist” take that discounted the discomfort of Franken’s accusers. For example, Vox’s Matthew Yglesias wrote a rebuttal titled “Al Franken did the right thing by resigning,” saying that **Mayer was wrong** and that Franken’s behavior, while not the worst, still merited consequences in the political context ([Al Franken’s resignation was right: Jane Mayer is wrong | Vox](https://www.vox.com/2019/7/22/20703617/al-franken-jane-mayer-resignation#:~:text=having%20pressured%20him%20to%20quit,arguing%20that%20Franken%20was%20wronged)). The Mayer article was seen by some as **undermining the credibility** of the #MeToo movement’s gains by implying a man accused by multiple women (Franken had eight accusations of groping or unwanted kisses) should have stayed in power. Others thought it opened a necessary conversation about proportionality and evidence. Franken himself, post-resignation, said he felt “redeemed” by Mayer’s reporting. The controversy underscored a divide in public opinion: even within progressive circles, there was disagreement about Franken’s case and, by extension, about how to handle gray-area misconduct. “The Case of Al Franken” remains a **polarizing piece** – lauded by those wary of *excesses* of cancel culture, and lambasted by those who believe it downplayed women’s experiences to rehabilitate a powerful man ([Al Franken’s resignation was right: Jane Mayer is wrong | Vox](https://www.vox.com/2019/7/22/20703617/al-franken-jane-mayer-resignation#:~:text=having%20pressured%20him%20to%20quit,arguing%20that%20Franken%20was%20wronged)).

### “Hasan Minhaj’s ‘Emotional Truths’” – Clare Malone (September 15, 2023)  
In September 2023, *The New Yorker* published a profile that unexpectedly embroiled the magazine in controversy involving the world of comedy. Titled “Hasan Minhaj’s ‘Emotional Truths’,” Clare Malone’s article scrutinized the stand-up comedian and former *Patriot Act* host Hasan Minhaj, revealing that several anecdotes in his performances were **embellished or fabricated** for dramatic effect ([Hasan Minhaj, the New Yorker, and the trouble with storytelling | Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/23954018/hasan-minhaj-new-yorker-controversy-daily-show-what-happened#:~:text=Rarely%20have%20public%20scandals%20been,discrimination%20in%20America%20after%209%2F11)). Minhaj had often told harrowing personal stories on stage – involving experiences of racism, a supposed FBI informant entrapment, and an incident where his young daughter was exposed to a suspicious white powder – to underscore points about being Muslim-American in the post-9/11 era. Malone’s reporting discovered that while the *premises* of these stories were based in truth, Minhaj had significantly fictionalized key details (for example, the powder was real but *his daughter never came into contact with it*) ([Hasan Minhaj Reflects on the ‘New Yorker’ Story a Year Later](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a62367518/hasan-minhaj-new-yorker/#:~:text=Minhaj%20eventually%20responded%20to%20the,and%20omissions%20in%20his%20storytelling)). The article quoted Minhaj defending his approach: **“My comedy… is 70% emotional truth… and then 30% hyperbole, exaggeration, fiction”**, a kind of “truthiness” he argued served a comedic and narrative purpose ([Hasan Minhaj Reflects on the ‘New Yorker’ Story a Year Later](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a62367518/hasan-minhaj-new-yorker/#:~:text=stand,%E2%80%9D)). The piece sparked a multi-faceted controversy about **truth in comedy** and whether a comedian who traffics in political and social commentary has an obligation to stick to the facts. Many readers and journalists criticized Minhaj, accusing him of betraying audience trust – especially since his comedy often carries a veneer of journalistic storytelling. There was also **backlash against The New Yorker**: some of Minhaj’s fans and fellow comedians argued that the magazine had performed a “needless hit job,” holding a comic to an unrealistic standard and perhaps derailing his career ([Hasan Minhaj, the New Yorker, and the trouble with storytelling | Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/23954018/hasan-minhaj-new-yorker-controversy-daily-show-what-happened#:~:text=The%20New%20Yorker%20tried%20to,It%20didn%E2%80%99t%20work)) ([Hasan Minhaj, the New Yorker, and the trouble with storytelling | Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/23954018/hasan-minhaj-new-yorker-controversy-daily-show-what-happened#:~:text=Rarely%20have%20public%20scandals%20been,discrimination%20in%20America%20after%209%2F11)). (Notably, it was reported that Minhaj, who was under consideration to become the next host of *The Daily Show*, lost that opportunity due in part to the bad press ([Hasan Minhaj Reflects on the ‘New Yorker’ Story a Year Later](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a62367518/hasan-minhaj-new-yorker/#:~:text=Even%20worse%2C%20Minhaj%20reportedly%20lost,%E2%80%9D)).) The debate extended onto social media, with some defending the creative liberties of stand-up and others applauding the magazine for **fact-checking a public figure’s narratives**. Minhaj himself responded a month later with a 20-minute video rebuttal, **disputing some details** of the article and insisting that his fabricated stories still conveyed essential truths about racism and bigotry (while also admitting regret over a couple of choices) ([Hasan Minhaj Reflects on the ‘New Yorker’ Story a Year Later](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a62367518/hasan-minhaj-new-yorker/#:~:text=Minhaj%20eventually%20responded%20to%20the,and%20omissions%20in%20his%20storytelling)) ([Hasan Minhaj Reflects on the ‘New Yorker’ Story a Year Later](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a62367518/hasan-minhaj-new-yorker/#:~:text=Image%3A%20youtubeView%20full%20post%20on,Youtube)). The incident highlighted a cultural divide: one side seeing Malone’s piece as holding a prominent voice accountable for honesty, and the other seeing it as an overzealous critique that didn’t fully account for the nuances of artistic storytelling. In any case, it put *The New Yorker* at the center of an unanticipated conversation about the line between fact and “emotional truth,” making this profile one of the magazine’s most talked-about and controversial pieces in recent years.

### “Shibboleth” – Zadie Smith (March 27, 2024)  
When acclaimed novelist Zadie Smith penned a 3,000-word essay titled “Shibboleth” for *The New Yorker* in spring 2024, the last thing she likely expected was an online firestorm. Yet upon its late-March publication, **immediate backlash** ensued. In the essay, Smith – known for her nuanced fiction – waded into the fraught territory of **language and campus activism**. She argued that a central problem in many modern student protests is an *imprecise use of language*, suggesting that terms and slogans were being used in ways that foreclosed dialogue. The piece was philosophical and dense, musing on how people accuse each other of being “privileged” or “colonizers” as a rhetorical flex. Critics, however, found Smith’s argument **tone-deaf and condescending**. As soon as “Shibboleth” went online, reaction on Twitter (X) was, in the words of one outlet, “nearly immediate and thunderous” ([Zadie Smith Sparks Controversy Due To New Yorker Essay -](https://www.blackenterprise.com/zadie-smith-controversy-new-yorker/#:~:text=After%20British%20author%20Zadie%20Smith,employment%20of%20language%20and%20rhetoric)). Many academics and writers of color took issue with Smith’s stance, saying she was essentially chastising young activists for **semantic sloppiness** instead of appreciating the substance of their grievances. Some pointed out that Smith, in trying to see “both sides” of campus debates, came off as offering unwanted advice to marginalized students – one Twitter critic paraphrased the essay as a pompous equivocation about words meaning things or not ([Zadie Smith Sparks Controversy Due To New Yorker Essay -](https://www.blackenterprise.com/zadie-smith-controversy-new-yorker/#:~:text=,djolder%29%20May%206%2C%202024)). Others dredged up past critiques of Smith, noting she had a history of what one critic called *“negative capability”* – seeing both sides – that “tends to land her in hot water” ([Zadie Smith Sparks Controversy Due To New Yorker Essay -](https://www.blackenterprise.com/zadie-smith-controversy-new-yorker/#:~:text=Vulture%20reposted%20a%202023%20review,is%20emblematic%20of%20this%20criticism)). In this case, the hot water was scalding: **social media lit up** with scholars and readers lambasting the piece as out of touch. Some particularly took offense at Smith’s use of the term “shibboleth” itself, arguing that her complex vocabulary only underscored a disconnect with the very people she was writing about. Supporters of Smith’s essay did exist – a few praised her intellectual bravery in questioning trendy rhetoric and urged readers to engage with her points. But in the loud cacophony of the internet, those voices were harder to hear. The controversy grew so prominent that it was covered by media outlets; for example, *Black Enterprise* summarized the backlash and noted how even a respected literary figure was not immune from Twitter fury ([Zadie Smith Sparks Controversy Due To New Yorker Essay -](https://www.blackenterprise.com/zadie-smith-controversy-new-yorker/#:~:text=After%20British%20author%20Zadie%20Smith,employment%20of%20language%20and%20rhetoric)). In the end, “Shibboleth” became a case study in the perils of cultural commentary: a reminder that **well-intentioned critique of social justice movements** can easily be interpreted as dismissal of those movements, especially in the quick-to-judge arena of social media. Smith herself did not publicly comment further, but the episode sparked ongoing discussion about generational divides in activism and how intellectuals should approach volatile topics. As a *New Yorker* publication, it stands out as a recent example of how a seemingly niche essay can ignite widespread controversy.
