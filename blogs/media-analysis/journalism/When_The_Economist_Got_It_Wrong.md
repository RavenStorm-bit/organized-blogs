Got it. I’ll dig into past articles and forecasts published by *The Economist* to identify notable cases where their predictions or opinions turned out to be incorrect or widely criticized in hindsight. This will include economic forecasts, political analysis, and major global trends.

I’ll summarize the key examples, explain the nature of the errors, and provide context around what actually happened. I’ll get back to you once I’ve gathered everything.

# When The Economist Got It Wrong: Notable Failed Forecasts

**The Economist** magazine has a long history of analyzing global affairs and making bold forecasts. While it often prides itself on prescient insights, there have been instances where its predictions and opinions missed the mark. This report examines some of the most striking cases over the past 20–30 years in which The Economist’s economic, political, or global trend forecasts proved inaccurate. We detail each case with the prediction, what actually happened, and reactions or hindsight commentary. A summary table of these notable miscalls is included at the end for quick reference.

## Economic Forecasts That Flopped

### “Drowning in Oil” – The 1999 Oil Glut That Wasn’t  
In March 1999, with crude oil around $10 a barrel after a steep two-year slide, The Economist ran a cover story titled **“Drowning in Oil.”** The article argued that the world was awash in oil and *“it is likely to remain so,”* even speculating prices could fall as low as $5 ([The Economist: ”Oil is yesterday’s fuel” | Aleklett's Energy Mix](https://aleklett.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/the-economist-oil-is-yesterdays-fuel/#:~:text=Economist%20published%20an%20article%20titled%2C,down%20to%20%245%20per%20barrel)). This pessimistic forecast came at what proved to be the bottom of the oil market. In reality, oil demand recovered and OPEC cut supply; far from collapsing to $5, prices began a steady climb. Within a few years oil was over $50, and by 2008 it hit $145 per barrel – a dramatic upturn that starkly contradicted the magazine’s call ([The Economist: ”Oil is yesterday’s fuel” | Aleklett's Energy Mix](https://aleklett.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/the-economist-oil-is-yesterdays-fuel/#:~:text=Scientific%20American%20that%20cheap%20oil,to%20over%20%24100%20per%20barrel)). The **“Drowning in Oil”** cover is now frequently cited as a classic failed prediction, illustrating how “magazine cover fever” can signal a turning point rather than a trend ([The Magazine Cover Indicator - Spectra Markets](https://www.spectramarkets.com/amfx/the-magazine-cover-indicator/#:~:text=Two%20very%20famous%20examples%20are,brought%20down%20the%20Russian%20economy)). Even The Economist later wryly admitted the cover was *“poorly timed,”* as the oil boom that followed made the $5 forecast look *“infamous”* in retrospect ([The Economist - "Drowning in oil" - March 6, 1999 "Our energy ...](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150267618404060&id=6013004059&set=a.10150267618299060#:~:text=,5%2C%20just%20that%20it)).

### The “Hopeless Continent” – Africa’s Surprise Renaissance  
In May 2000, The Economist’s cover **“The hopeless continent”** painted a bleak picture of Africa’s future. The accompanying article catalogued wars, famine, and chaos, concluding that *“the new millennium has brought more disaster than hope to Africa”* and that the few glimmers of hope were *“flickering weakly.”* ([How The Economist changed its tune on Africa](https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/how-the-economist-changed-its-tune-on-africa/14001/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) This dire prognosis proved far too pessimistic. In the ensuing decade, many African economies experienced a historic boom: Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP **tripled** and average incomes more than **doubled**, accompanied by sharp improvements in health and education indicators ([It was once dubbed the 'hopeless continent', but Africa is on the rise - CapX](https://capx.co/it-was-once-dubbed-the-hopeless-continent-but-africa-is-on-the-rise#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20over%20the%20last,write%20since%20the%20year%202000)). Two decades on, life expectancy had climbed by 10 years and tens of millions were lifted out of extreme poverty ([It was once dubbed the 'hopeless continent', but Africa is on the rise - CapX](https://capx.co/it-was-once-dubbed-the-hopeless-continent-but-africa-is-on-the-rise#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20over%20the%20last,write%20since%20the%20year%202000)). Even The Economist acknowledged its error—by 2011 it regretted having *“labelled Africa ‘the hopeless continent’”* and noted that *“a profound change has taken hold”* across the continent ([How The Economist changed its tune on Africa](https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/how-the-economist-changed-its-tune-on-africa/14001/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). That year the magazine reversed course with a new optimistic cover, **“Africa Rising,”** recognizing Africa’s growth surge. (Ironically, some later noted that this **“Africa rising”** optimism, while a welcome correction, proved somewhat premature as the early-2010s commodity boom waned ([Mwangi - X](https://x.com/MwangiMaina_/status/1903731344393531422#:~:text=The%20Economist%20lamented%20the%20%E2%80%9CHopeless,lived%20and%20comparatively%20weak)). We examine this next.)

### “Africa Rising” – Boom and Backlash  
By **2011**, Africa’s rapid growth led The Economist to declare **“Africa Rising”** (subtitled *“The Hopeful Continent”*) on its cover, signaling a complete U-turn from a decade earlier. The magazine highlighted burgeoning economies like Ghana, Ethiopia and Nigeria, a growing middle class, and investor optimism. At the time, the narrative of sustained African economic takeoff was widely embraced. However, the subsequent years showed a more mixed reality. The growth spurt of about 2000–2014, though real, **“was short-lived and comparatively weak”** in historical context ([Mwangi - X](https://x.com/MwangiMaina_/status/1903731344393531422#:~:text=The%20Economist%20lamented%20the%20%E2%80%9CHopeless,lived%20and%20comparatively%20weak)). After 2014, falling commodity prices and other headwinds slowed Africa’s average growth, and development gains remained uneven. Critics argued that **“Africa rising”** was overstated – a hopeful narrative that ignored structural challenges ([The myth of Africa's rise - Third World Network (TWN)](https://www.twn.my/title2/twe/2013/536/3.htm#:~:text=This%20%E2%80%9CAfrica%20rising%E2%80%9D%20narrative%20has,publications%20are%20wrong%20in)) ([Africa: Why Economists Get It Wrong (African Arguments) (Paperback)](https://www.harvard.com/book/9781783601325#:~:text=)). In hindsight, Africa’s trajectory has been neither hopeless nor unambiguously rising; The Economist’s contrasting covers in 2000 and 2011 illustrate the difficulty of capturing a complex trend with a simple prediction. The **“Hopeless Continent”** label has been debunked by real progress, while **“Africa Rising”** proved too optimistic about the speed of that progress.

### The “Death of Inflation” – Low Prices Didn’t Last  
For much of the 2000s and early 2010s, inflation in advanced economies stayed persistently low, defying older expectations. In April 2013, The Economist ran a piece titled **“The death of inflation,”** suggesting that central banks had *“been too successful”* at taming price pressures and that the era of high inflation was over ([The death of inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/04/13/the-death-of-inflation#:~:text=The%20death%20of%20inflation)). This view reflected a broader consensus at the time that structural forces (globalization, technology, prudent monetary policy) had permanently subdued inflation. However, less than a decade later, this obituary for inflation proved premature. By 2021–2022, inflation came roaring back across the world – U.S. and European inflation hit multi-decade highs, surprising policymakers and economists. Many who had declared inflation “dead” were caught off guard as consumer prices surged post-pandemic ([The Return of Inflation: Money and Capital in the 21st Century, Mattick](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/R/bo208670126.html#:~:text=Mattick%20press,before%20suddenly%20rising%20in%202021)). A quarter century after some experts (e.g. Roger Bootle) famously forecast the end of inflation, they had to concede the dragon was not slain ([Economist Who Said Inflation Was Dead Now Thinks It's Alive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-07/inflation-outlook-economist-roger-bootle-sees-consumer-prices-surge-after-covid#:~:text=Alive%20www,confidential%20tip%20for%20our)). The Economist’s assumption of permanently low inflation fell apart in the face of supply shocks and stimulus-fueled demand, reminding everyone that economic paradigms can shift. In hindsight, **“The Death of Inflation”** was a cautionary tale about declaring victory too soon – as one analysis noted, economists *“failed to explain why inflation stayed unexpectedly low for a decade”* and then *“before [they knew it], [it] suddenly [rose] in 2021.”* ([The Return of Inflation: Money and Capital in the 21st Century, Mattick](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/R/bo208670126.html#:~:text=Mattick%20press,before%20suddenly%20rising%20in%202021))

### The Recession That Never Came (2023)  
In late 2022, storm clouds gathered in the global economy – war in Ukraine, energy spikes, and monetary tightening led many to predict an imminent worldwide recession in 2023. The Economist was among them. In November 2022, it published a stark outlook titled **“Why a global recession is inevitable in 2023,”** confidently forecasting that much of the world would be in recession in the coming year ([The World Ahead 2023 - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-world-ahead-2023#:~:text=The%20World%20Ahead%202023%20,Ukraine%20has%20a)). However, by the end of 2023, this prediction had largely failed to materialize. While growth did slow and some countries fell into mild recession, a **synchronized global downturn** was avoided. The U.S. and European economies showed surprising resilience, and China’s re-opening provided a boost. As one commentator dryly noted, The Economist’s headline declared recession *“inevitable”* in 2023, *“[but] it did not happen.”* ([Forget Taylor Swift — 2023 recession was thwarted by larger trend](https://eastoregonian.com/2024/02/15/forget-taylor-swift-2023-recession-was-thwarted-by-larger-trend/#:~:text=Forget%20Taylor%20Swift%20%E2%80%94%202023,It%20did%20not%20happen)) The widely expected recession turned into a “soft landing” or was delayed, prompting much soul-searching in the forecasting community about what was missed. In this case, The Economist was far from alone in its error – an array of banks and think-tanks also issued grim 2023 forecasts that proved overly dour ([Why everyone was so wrong about the 2023 economy - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/22/2023-economy-predictions-wrong-recession#:~:text=Why%20everyone%20was%20so%20wrong,next%20month%2C%20the%20Economist)) ([Whassup with those economists who predicted a recession that then ...](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/05/31/whassup-with-those-economists-who-predicted-a-recession-that-then-didnt-happen/#:~:text=,tells%20us%20about%20the%20future)). The episode underscored the perennial challenge of economic forecasting: even when virtually *everyone* expects a recession, reality can turn out differently.

## Political Prognoses Off Target

### Brexit Referendum – A Shock Result  
**2016 Brexit Referendum:** Ahead of Britain’s June 2016 vote on whether to leave the EU, The Economist (which openly favored Remain) and most pundits anticipated a narrow **Remain** victory. Polls and betting markets had consistently shown Remain in the lead, and the magazine’s analysis reflected that conventional wisdom. In fact, on the eve of the vote The Economist’s editors wrote confidently about the case for staying in the EU, and there was little suggestion that Leave would actually prevail. The outcome – a 52% majority for **Leave (Brexit)** – stunned the establishment. *“The vote stunned pollsters and pundits,”* The Economist later observed, as virtually every expert forecast had gotten it wrong ([How Donald Trump won the election](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/11/09/how-donald-trump-won-the-election#:~:text=IT%20IS%20the%20biggest%20political,rival%2C%20would%20breeze%20to%20victory)). The Economist was no exception: its own model and commentary failed to predict the electorate’s defiance of expectations. Moreover, many economists (including The Economist’s writers) predicted immediate economic turmoil if Brexit passed – for example, a swift slide into recession and a market crash. In reality, while the pound’s value tumbled overnight, the UK economy did not enter recession in 2016; consumer spending and growth held up better than predicted in the short term ([Brexit - Did the economists get it wrong? - The Federal Trust](https://fedtrust.co.uk/brexit-did-the-economists-get-it-wrong/#:~:text=Trust%20fedtrust,June%20to%20leave%20the)) ([Doomsday predictions on Brexit were wrong - Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/feb/19/doomsday-predictions-on-brexit-were-wrong/#:~:text=Times%20www,But%2C%20as%20of%20this)). This is not to say forecasts of Brexit’s impact were entirely wrong – in the longer run, UK growth did lag and investment suffered – but the timing and magnitude were off. The blown call on the referendum result itself, however, remains one of the magazine’s most notable political misjudgments. It highlighted how voter populism and “irrational” factors confounded models that were based on historical patterns (a point even the Bank of England’s chief economist admitted regarding economists’ Brexit predictions ([Chief economist of Bank of England admits errors in Brexit forecasting](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/chief-economist-of-bank-of-england-admits-errors#:~:text=Chief%20economist%20of%20Bank%20of,narrow%20models%20ignored%20%27irrational%20behaviour))). In sum, Brexit taught The Economist a humbling lesson: when it comes to referendums and politics, expect the unexpected.

### The Trump Upset of 2016  
In the **2016 U.S. presidential election**, The Economist – like nearly all major media and polling aggregators – did not foresee Donald Trump’s victory. The magazine’s election forecasting model, unveiled during the campaign, gave Trump very slim odds. At one point The Economist’s model put Trump’s chances at around **5%**, effectively implying a near-certainty of a Hillary Clinton win ([“Expert” election models say Trump is almost certain to lose. The ...](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157192415921621&id=46675576620#:~:text=%E2%80%9CExpert%E2%80%9D%20election%20models%20say%20Trump,Nate%20Silver%20gives%20him%20just)). The Economist’s coverage echoed the prevailing sentiment that Clinton would *“breeze to victory.”* After all, most polls showed her ahead nationally and in key swing states. On Election Night, the shocking outcome saw Trump win the Electoral College. *“It is the biggest political upset in living memory,”* The Economist’s data team wrote, noting that the result *“stunned pollsters and pundits”* who had confidently expected a Clinton presidency ([How Donald Trump won the election](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/11/09/how-donald-trump-won-the-election#:~:text=IT%20IS%20the%20biggest%20political,rival%2C%20would%20breeze%20to%20victory)). The magazine (which had been strongly critical of Trump) was left examining why its model missed the mark. In hindsight, analysts pointed to factors like underestimating “shy” Trump voters, over-relying on past voting patterns, and not accounting for the unique surge in rural turnout. The Economist’s own post-mortem acknowledged a *“midsized polling mistake”* that was amplified by assumptions in models ([How did the polls get it wrong? - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/11/09/how-did-the-polls-get-it-wrong#:~:text=The%20polls%20foresaw%20a%20four,The%20Economist%20explains)). This high-profile miss – alongside Brexit earlier that year – damaged the reputation of expert political forecasts. It also illustrated a theme: rare or unprecedented events (an outsider like Trump winning, against odds) were treated as virtually impossible by models, when in reality low-probability events can and do occur. The Economist was far from alone in erring on Trump’s chances, but its **5% probability call** now serves as a cautionary example of overconfidence. The magazine’s 2020 election model was noticeably recalibrated to avoid a repeat, but the 2016 miss remains a memorable blot in its forecasting record.

### Iraq’s WMD and the 2003 Invasion  
Sometimes the magazine’s mistaken predictions were implicit in the opinions it advocated. A clear example is **The Economist’s stance in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War**. The publication strongly supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, largely on the grounds that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) that posed a grave threat. In early 2003, an Economist editorial *“The case for war”* argued that Saddam was not disarming and that war was a justified and necessary risk ([The case for war - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/2003/01/29/the-case-for-war#:~:text=Mr%20Blix%20said%20Iraq%20did,While%20the%20inspectors)). The expectation was that coalition forces would find Saddam’s banned weapons programs and liberate Iraqis, leading to a better post-war outcome. These assumptions turned out to be tragically mistaken. After the invasion, **no WMD stockpiles were ever found** in Iraq – the very premise of the war was false. As The Economist later bluntly noted, *“The main reason given to justify the invasion…turned out to be wrong.”* ([The Economist | - Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/photos/the-iraq-war-was-extremely-controversial-in-britain-the-main-reason-given-to-jus/10154357462054060/#:~:text=The%20Economist%20%7C%20,turned%20out%20to%20be%20wrong)) In the war’s aftermath, Iraq plunged into years of insurgency and sectarian violence, far from the quick democratic transition many had hoped for. The Economist initially predicted a difficult but manageable reconstruction; instead Iraq’s turmoil exceeded worst-case expectations. The magazine faced considerable criticism for cheerleading the war. Critics pointed out that by trusting flawed intelligence and rosy scenarios, The Economist’s analysis failed to foresee the chaos that toppling Saddam would unleash. Within months, even The Economist questioned *“was the war really worth it”* in a July 2003 follow-up piece, as it became clear that WMD were absent and post-war planning had been woefully inadequate ([The case for war—revisited - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2003/07/17/the-case-for-war-revisited#:~:text=The%20case%20for%20war%E2%80%94revisited%20,was%20the%20war%20really)). This episode stands as one of The Economist’s more consequential misjudgments. While it was an error shared by many media outlets at the time, The Economist’s influential endorsement of the war – and its incorrect prediction that Iraq possessed WMD – is often cited as a dark mark in its record. The lesson was that even a venerable publication could be swept up in prevailing narratives, only to be proven wrong by facts on the ground.

## Misreading Emerging Trends

### Brazil’s “Take Off” and Crash Landing  
At the end of 2009, amid optimism about emerging markets, The Economist featured **Brazil** on its cover with the triumphant headline **“Brazil takes off”**. The cover image famously depicted Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue launching like a rocket – symbolizing Brazil’s booming economy and newfound international prominence. And indeed, by 2009 Brazil had come through the global financial crisis relatively well and was enjoying commodity-fueled growth. The Economist’s November 2009 issue heralded Brazil’s stable inflation, millions lifted from poverty, and suggested the country had *“finally fulfilled its potential”* as a rising power. But this bullish narrative would soon meet a harsh reality. Within just a few years, Brazil’s economy hit a wall. By 2014–2015 Brazil entered its worst recession in decades, compounded by a massive corruption scandal (Petrobras and “Operation Car Wash”) and a political crisis that led to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. The contrast to the magazine’s rosy projections was striking. As one analysis noted in 2015, only **six years after** the rocket-like “Brazil takes off” cover, Brazil was mired in *“recession, a radical currency devaluation, fiscal crisis,”* and presidential approval ratings in single digits ([

](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/brazil-back-to-future/#:~:text=Even%20though%20things%20can%20always,Brazil%20takes%20off)) ([
    
        Brazil: back to the future | openDemocracy
    
](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/brazil-back-to-future/#:~:text=Datafolha%2C%20which%20since%201990%20has,an%20approval%20rating%20of%209)). The Economist’s optimistic take in 2009 had not foreseen how quickly Brazil’s fortunes could reverse. Critics later pointed out that the structural issues (over-reliance on commodities, poor infrastructure, political dysfunction) were glossed over amid the euphoria. The magazine did eventually acknowledge Brazil’s crash: by 2015 it wrote about **“Brazil’s crash landing”** and the end of the commodities supercycle. The **“Brazil takes off”** miscall is often remembered alongside similar exuberant headlines (like **“Africa Rising”**) that, with hindsight, proved to be peak hype at the cusp of a downturn. It demonstrated the perils of extrapolating short-run success into long-term destiny.

### The Euro’s Near-Death (False Alarm)  
The Economist has long covered Europe’s economic integration, and at times its prognostications on the euro currency have been off. A notable case was during the **Eurozone debt crisis (2010–2012)**. As Greece, Ireland, and others teetered on default, The Economist published numerous pieces assessing the survival of the euro. In mid-2012, for example, one article raised its estimated probability of a Greek exit (“Grexit”) from the euro to **50%**, and the magazine argued it was time to *“prepare for [Greece’s] departure”* ([Get the Hellas out of here - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2012/02/07/get-the-hellas-out-of-here#:~:text=Get%20the%20Hellas%20out%20of,18%20months%20from%20earlier)) ([The Greek run - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2012/05/19/the-greek-run#:~:text=The%20Greek%20run%20,May%2019th%202012)). Some Economist analyses suggested the euro zone might break apart under the strain, or at least that one or more countries would be forced out. In fact, despite coming dangerously close to the brink (especially in Greece’s case), **no country left the euro**. Through frantic diplomacy and European Central Bank intervention (“whatever it takes”), the Eurozone held together. By 2013–2014, market panic subsided and the common currency survived its existential crisis. The Economist’s 50/50 Grexit odds in 2012 thus did not transpire – Greece stayed in, and a euro breakup was averted. With hindsight, those dire predictions did not account enough for the political will in Europe to save the euro at all costs. (As it happens, The Economist had been skeptical of the euro’s viability even at its launch in 1999; conversely, it also once urged Britain to join the euro, a move that Britain never made – arguably to its benefit. Both instances could be seen as the magazine hedging incorrectly on Europe’s grand experiment.) While the Eurozone crisis was genuinely perilous, The Economist’s implicit forecast of an imminent unraveling of the euro proved too negative. The currency union endures to this day, defying the many premature obituaries written at the time.

The cases above underscore that even a highly respected publication like The Economist can and does get things wrong. Forecasting is a tricky business: trends change, “present trends” reverse, and unforeseen factors intervene. To its credit, The Economist has at times owned up to its miscalls – as in a 1999 year-end special titled **“We woz wrong,”** where its editor catalogued recent forecasting goofs and quoted Keynes: *“When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”* ([We woz wrong](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/1999/12/16/we-woz-wrong#:~:text=We%20woz%20wrong)) ([We woz wrong](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/1999/12/16/we-woz-wrong#:~:text=A%20MESSAGE%20was%20sent%20to,issue%20of%20October%2017th%201998)). Each mistake carries lessons. From oil prices to political shocks, the notable failed predictions detailed here have humbled forecasters and sparked debate. Industry observers have variously criticized The Economist for hubris in some of these instances, while in others the magazine was simply echoing a consensus that turned out to be flawed. In any case, these episodes provide a historical perspective on how even the savviest analysts can be blindsided by reality. The table below summarizes each of these notable forecast failures by The Economist, highlighting the prediction, outcome, and hindsight commentary.

| **2000 – “The Hopeless Continent”** | Africa is mired in war and famine; the new millennium brings *“more disaster than hope”* for Africa ([How The Economist changed its tune on Africa](https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/how-the-economist-changed-its-tune-on-africa/14001/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) ([It was once dubbed the 'hopeless continent', but Africa is on the rise - CapX](https://capx.co/it-was-once-dubbed-the-hopeless-continent-but-africa-is-on-the-rise#:~:text=Back%20in%202000%2C%20The%20Economist,sombre%20diagnosis%2C%20much%20has%20changed)). Implied **bleak future** for the continent. | African economies surged after 2000. Over 2000–2010, Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP **tripled** and many nations saw growth, poverty reduction, and improved stability ([It was once dubbed the 'hopeless continent', but Africa is on the rise - CapX](https://capx.co/it-was-once-dubbed-the-hopeless-continent-but-africa-is-on-the-rise#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20over%20the%20last,write%20since%20the%20year%202000)). | The cover proved **embarrassingly wrong**. In 2011 The Economist admitted its label was *“regrettably”* off-base ([How The Economist changed its tune on Africa](https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/how-the-economist-changed-its-tune-on-africa/14001/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). The phrase “hopeless continent” is now infamous and often criticized as short-sighted. |
| **2003 – Case for Iraq War**      | Asserted **Saddam Hussein has WMDs** and must be disarmed by force ([The case for war - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/2003/01/29/the-case-for-war#:~:text=Mr%20Blix%20said%20Iraq%20did,While%20the%20inspectors)). Predicted a safer world and better future for Iraq after invasion. | No WMD were found in Iraq. The main rationale for war collapsed. Post-invasion Iraq descended into insurgency and chaos, not the quick democratic transition hoped for. | Viewed as a major **misjudgment**. *“This turned out to be wrong,”* The Economist later conceded bluntly about the WMD premise ([The Economist | - Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/photos/the-iraq-war-was-extremely-controversial-in-britain-the-main-reason-given-to-jus/10154357462054060/#:~:text=The%20Economist%20%7C%20,turned%20out%20to%20be%20wrong)). The magazine, like many, faced criticism for advocating a war on faulty intelligence. |
| **2009 – “Brazil Takes Off”**     | Celebrated Brazil’s economic boom, suggesting the country had finally achieved sustained take-off (high growth, stable economy, declining inequality). **Optimistic forecast** for Brazil’s future as a rising power. | Brazil’s boom fizzled. By 2014–2015 Brazil fell into a **deep recession** with double-digit inflation and political turmoil (massive corruption scandals). Hopes of sustained growth gave way to a crisis that wiped out years of progress ([

Analysts noted the rapid reversal – *“six years ago”* Brazil was on Economist’s cover as soaring, but now in “traumatic” crisis ([

](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/brazil-back-to-future/#:~:text=must%20make%20Rousseff%20miss%20the,Brazil%20takes%20off)). The cover is often lampooned after Brazil’s crash, highlighting the risk of overhyping emerging markets. |
| **2011 – “Africa Rising”**        | Declared a new era of African growth: **“Africa rising”** with expanding economies and a hopeful future (reversing the 2000 stance). Suggested the boom would continue and Africa was on a path of sustained development. | Africa’s early-2010s growth spurt proved **short-lived**. After 2014, growth rates fell with commodity price drops. Overall, the continent’s income gap with the world stopped narrowing ([The economic gap between Africa and the rest of the world is growing](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2025/01/06/the-economic-gap-between-africa-and-the-rest-of-the-world-is-growing#:~:text=The%20economic%20gap%20between%20Africa,real%20gdp%20per%20person)). Some gains endured, but the broad-based “rising” narrative stalled out. | Seen as **over-optimistic**. The Economist itself noted in 2025 that the *“Africa Rising”* boom was *“comparatively weak”* and fleeting ([Mwangi - X](https://x.com/MwangiMaina_/status/1903731344393531422#:~:text=The%20Economist%20lamented%20the%20%E2%80%9CHopeless,lived%20and%20comparatively%20weak)). Critics argue the magazine swung from undue pessimism to **undue optimism** – reality was more nuanced than either cover suggested. |
| **2013 – “The Death of Inflation”** | Argued that inflation had been vanquished in advanced economies, thanks to central bank prowess. Implied the era of persistently low inflation would continue indefinitely ([The death of inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/04/13/the-death-of-inflation#:~:text=The%20death%20of%20inflation)). | Inflation came roaring back in the 2020s. By 2021–2022, the U.S. and Eurozone saw inflation surge to ~40-year highs (5–10%+), confounding the expectation of permanently low inflation ([The Return of Inflation: Money and Capital in the 21st Century, Mattick](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/R/bo208670126.html#:~:text=Mattick%20press,before%20suddenly%20rising%20in%202021)). | **Egg on face** for the low-inflation consensus. Economists were **“surprised by the recent surge”** in prices ([The Return of Inflation: Money and Capital in the 21st Century, Mattick](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/R/bo208670126.html#:~:text=Mattick%20press,before%20suddenly%20rising%20in%202021)). The phrase “death of inflation” proved premature – a caution that economic regimes can flip. (Roger Bootle, who popularized the term in the 1990s, publicly reversed his stance as inflation resurfaced ([Economist Who Said Inflation Was Dead Now Thinks It's Alive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-07/inflation-outlook-economist-roger-bootle-sees-consumer-prices-surge-after-covid#:~:text=Alive%20www,confidential%20tip%20for%20our)).) |
| **2016 – Brexit Referendum**      | Expected UK voters would **reject Brexit**. The Economist (and most experts) predicted a Remain win, and also warned of immediate recession if Leave won. | Voters shocked pundits by **approving Brexit (52% Leave)**. No instant recession occurred in 2016; the UK economy kept growing (albeit more slowly than pre-vote) ([Brexit - Did the economists get it wrong? - The Federal Trust](https://fedtrust.co.uk/brexit-did-the-economists-get-it-wrong/#:~:text=Trust%20fedtrust,June%20to%20leave%20the)) ([Doomsday predictions on Brexit were wrong - Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/feb/19/doomsday-predictions-on-brexit-were-wrong/#:~:text=Times%20www,But%2C%20as%20of%20this)). | The outcome was a **major surprise** ([How Donald Trump won the election](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/11/09/how-donald-trump-won-the-election#:~:text=IT%20IS%20the%20biggest%20political,rival%2C%20would%20breeze%20to%20victory)). The Economist’s incorrect call echoed the polling miss – prompting scrutiny of why elites didn’t grasp voters’ anger. Economic forecasts of post-vote collapse were toned down when the immediate downturn failed to materialize. |
| **2016 – U.S. Election**          | Gave Donald Trump extremely low odds (as low as **5%**) of winning the presidency ([“Expert” election models say Trump is almost certain to lose. The ...](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157192415921621&id=46675576620#:~:text=%E2%80%9CExpert%E2%80%9D%20election%20models%20say%20Trump,Nate%20Silver%20gives%20him%20just)). Assumed Hillary Clinton would win handily, in line with polls and historical models. | Trump achieved a stunning upset, winning the Electoral College. The result defied the probabilities and surprised almost all forecasters. | **Widespread astonishment**. The Economist noted the election *“stunned… pundits”* who had Clinton as nearly certain ([How Donald Trump won the election](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/11/09/how-donald-trump-won-the-election#:~:text=IT%20IS%20the%20biggest%20political,rival%2C%20would%20breeze%20to%20victory)). The magazine’s model was criticized for overconfidence. This miss, along with Brexit, became emblematic of expert models’ **blind spots** (e.g. underestimating “black swan” events and voter volatility). |
| **2022 – Global Recession in 2023** | Predicted an **“inevitable” global recession in 2023** due to geopolitical shocks and tightening financial conditions ([The World Ahead 2023 - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-world-ahead-2023#:~:text=The%20World%20Ahead%202023%20,Ukraine%20has%20a)). Expected multiple major economies to contract. | A broad global recession **did not occur** in 2023. Many economies showed resilience; while some had mild recessions, global growth remained positive (albeit slower). The U.S. and Eurozone avoided recessions for the year. | The forecast proved **too bearish**. Commentators pointed out that The Economist’s bold headline *“inevitable in 2023”* was incorrect ([Forget Taylor Swift — 2023 recession was thwarted by larger trend](https://eastoregonian.com/2024/02/15/forget-taylor-swift-2023-recession-was-thwarted-by-larger-trend/#:~:text=Forget%20Taylor%20Swift%20%E2%80%94%202023,It%20did%20not%20happen)). The error was shared by many forecasters (e.g. Bloomberg’s model put odds at 100% ([Why everyone was so wrong about the 2023 economy - Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/22/2023-economy-predictions-wrong-recession#:~:text=Why%20everyone%20was%20so%20wrong,next%20month%2C%20the%20Economist))). It sparked discussions on why the worst didn’t materialize – e.g. consumers kept spending, central banks managed a soft landing. |
