Excellent. I’ll create a detailed timeline from the 17th to 21st century highlighting the most influential works and thinkers across math, computer science, logic, and philosophy—focusing only on those who produced landmark written works. I’ll include key figures, the title and year of each major work, and its significance.

I'll get started and let you know when it's ready to review.

## 17th Century (1600s)

- **1620 – Francis Bacon, *Novum Organum* (Philosophy):** Bacon advocated a new scientific method based on inductive reasoning, demonstrating “the use of the scientific method to discover knowledge about the natural world.” This work laid the groundwork for empirical science by rejecting scholastic syllogism and emphasizing observation and experiment ([Novum Organum | Online Library of Liberty](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/bacon-novum-organum#:~:text=Part%20of%20a%20larger%20but,nature%20of%20heat%20and%20energy)).

- **1637 – René Descartes, *Discourse on the Method* (Philosophy/Mathematics):** Descartes’ treatise introduced a systematic method of doubt and inquiry, famously stating *“I think, therefore I am.”* As an appendix, it included *La Géométrie*, which founded analytic geometry by linking algebra to geometry – providing a foundation for calculus in Europe ([Analytic geometry - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry#:~:text=Directing%20One%27s%20Reason%20and%20Searching,12)). This dual legacy made Descartes a father of modern philosophy and mathematics.

- **1677 – Baruch Spinoza, *Ethics* (Philosophy):** Published posthumously, Spinoza’s *Ethics* is a rationalist masterpiece presented in Euclidean “geometric” style. It identifies God with Nature, proposing a monist, deterministic universe. Its materialist and atheistic outlook was radical for its time – Spinoza became *“one of the great fathers of Enlightenment thinking,”* challenging religious authority and influencing later philosophers ([The Enlightenment and Spinoza's revolutionary rationalism](https://marxist.com/the-enlightenment-and-spinoza-s-revolutionary-rationalism.htm#:~:text=Born%20in%201632%20in%20the,of%20both%20Church%20and%20state)) ([The Enlightenment and Spinoza's revolutionary rationalism](https://marxist.com/the-enlightenment-and-spinoza-s-revolutionary-rationalism.htm#:~:text=explains%2C%20Spinoza%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%20%E2%80%93%20which,of%20both%20Church%20and%20state)).

- **1687 – Isaac Newton, *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (Mathematics/Natural Philosophy):** Newton’s *Principia* is *“the fundamental work for the whole of modern science,”* laying out the three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation ([Principia | Meaning, Newton, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Principia#:~:text=Principia%2C%20book%20%20about%20,to%20nature%20in%20every%20detail)). It provided a mathematical foundation for classical mechanics and showed how calculus (developed geometrically within) could be applied to explain planetary motion, thus transforming physics and mathematics ([Principia | Meaning, Newton, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Principia#:~:text=Principia%2C%20book%20%20about%20,to%20nature%20in%20every%20detail)).

- **1689 – John Locke, *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (Philosophy):** Locke’s *Essay* presented an elaborate empiricist account of human knowledge, arguing that the mind begins as a blank slate (*tabula rasa*). Its impact was enormous – *“perhaps as great as that of any other philosophical work”* – and it *“constitutes the foundation of modern Western philosophy”* along with Descartes’ writings ([An Essay Concerning Human Understanding | John Locke, Theories, Empiricism, & Epistemology | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Essay-Concerning-Human-Understanding#:~:text=An%20Essay%20Concerning%20Human%20Understanding%2C)). Locke’s theory of ideas and notion of natural rights deeply influenced Enlightenment thought.

- **1684 – Gottfried W. Leibniz, *Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis* (Mathematics):** In this 1684 paper, Leibniz introduced **differential calculus**, publishing for the first time the rules of infinitesimal calculus. It is considered “the first published work on calculus” and essentially *“the birth of infinitesimal calculus.”* Crucially, Leibniz’s notation and approach – using symbols like ∫ and d – became the standard language of calculus ([Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Methodus_pro_Maximis_et_Minimis#:~:text=,2)), giving mathematics a powerful new tool for analysis.

## 18th Century (1700s)

- **1748 – David Hume, *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* (Philosophy):** Hume’s Enquiry distilled his empiricist and skeptical philosophy into a concise form. It examined the limits of human knowledge – famously questioning causation and induction – and argued that our beliefs are grounded in habit rather than certain reason. This work had *“a long-lasting impact on the history of Western philosophy,”* profoundly influencing Kant and the later development of empiricism ([David Hume: An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding | TheCollector](https://www.thecollector.com/david-hume-philosophy-human-understanding/#:~:text=David%20Hume%E2%80%99s%20most%20readable%20and,Hume%E2%80%99s%20ideas%20considered%20so%20controversial)).

- **1748 – Leonhard Euler, *Introductio in analysin infinitorum* (Mathematics):** Euler’s two-volume *Introductio* was a comprehensive survey that *“lays the foundations of mathematical analysis.”* Published in 1748, it is considered the first modern *precalculus* textbook ([Introductio in analysin infinitorum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introductio_in_analysin_infinitorum#:~:text=Introductio%20in%20analysin%20infinitorum%20,considered%20the%20first%20precalculus%20book)). Euler introduced the notion of a mathematical *function* (using $f(x)$ notation) and systematically developed concepts of infinite series, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc., all *“without using differentiation or integration,”* thus shaping analysis for future generations ([Introductio in analysin infinitorum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introductio_in_analysin_infinitorum#:~:text=The%20Introduction%20is%20meant%20as,4)).

- **1781 – Immanuel Kant, *Critique of Pure Reason* (Philosophy):** Kant’s *Critique* is a **foundational study of human knowledge and metaphysics** that effected *“a lasting revolution in philosophical thought.”* In this 1781 work, Kant performed a “Copernican revolution” in philosophy – synthesizing rationalism and empiricism by arguing that our knowledge is constrained by the structures of our mind. By reconceiving the nature and methodology of philosophy, Kant *“is widely regarded as the greatest philosopher of the modern period,”* and the *Critique* remains a cornerstone of epistemology ([Critique of Pure Reason | Contents, Editions, Significance, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Critique-of-Pure-Reason#:~:text=Pure%20Reason%2C%20was%20the%20first,greatest%20philosophers%20of%20all%20time)).

## 19th Century (1800s)

- **1801 – Carl F. Gauss, *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae* (Mathematics):** Gauss’s *Disquisitiones* is often called the “holy writ” of number theory ([Disquisitiones Arithmeticae | book by Gauss | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Disquisitiones-Arithmeticae#:~:text=Of%20immense%20significance%20was%20the,predecessors%20before%20moving%20boldly%20to%E2%80%A6)). This Latin treatise systematically organized prior results (from Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, etc.) and then presented Gauss’s own new findings – such as the first rigorous proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and the law of quadratic reciprocity. Published when Gauss was only 24, it *“established number theory as a central subject in mathematics”* ([Disquisitiones Arithmeticae | book by Gauss | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Disquisitiones-Arithmeticae#:~:text=In%20mathematics%3A%20The%20theory%20of,numbers)) and guided the field’s future development.

- **1843 – Ada Lovelace, *Notes on the Analytical Engine* (Computer Science):** Ada Lovelace’s notes (appended to Luigi Menabrea’s paper on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine) outlined in detail how the machine could be programmed. In Note G, she described an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers – widely considered **the first computer program** ([Ada Lovelace - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#:~:text=Between%201842%20and%201843%2C%20Lovelace,8%20%5D%20She)) ([Ada Lovelace - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#:~:text=also%20developed%20a%20vision%20of,Ada%20is%20named%20after%20her)). Lovelace also foresaw that computers could manipulate symbols beyond mere calculation (for example, composing music). For recognizing that a computer could *“follow a series of simple instructions, a program, to perform a complex calculation,”* Lovelace is celebrated as *“the first computer programmer.”* ([Ada Lovelace | Biography, Computer, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ada-Lovelace#:~:text=Why%20is%20Ada%20Lovelace%20famous%3F))

- **1843 – John Stuart Mill, *A System of Logic* (Philosophy/Logic):** Mill’s two-volume *System of Logic* set out a rigorous empiricist methodology for science and reasoning. It was *“enormously influential”* ([A System of Logic | work by Mill | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/A-System-of-Logic#:~:text=In%20Western%20philosophy%3A%20Positivism%20and,in%20Comte%2C%20Mill%2C%20and%20Marx)) in philosophy and social science. Notably, Mill formulated the **five canons of inductive logic** (Mill’s Methods) for identifying causes from effects, and argued that even logic and mathematics are rooted in experience ([A System of Logic | work by Mill | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/A-System-of-Logic#:~:text=In%20positivism%3A%20The%20social%20positivism,of%20Comte%20and%20Mill)). This treatise helped solidify the framework of the scientific method in the social sciences and represented the apex of 19th-century empiricist logic.

- **1854 – George Boole, *An Investigation of the Laws of Thought* (Logic/Mathematics):** Boole’s work founded **Boolean algebra**, treating logical propositions algebraically. This *“seminal work on algebraic logic”* ([An Investigation of the Laws of Thought by George Boole | Blurb Books](https://www.blurb.com/b/5468915-an-investigation-of-the-laws-of-thought#:~:text=Edit)) introduced a symbolic language (with variables for truth values and operations like AND, OR, NOT) to express the “laws of thought.” Boole showed that logical reasoning could be captured by equations (with 1 for true, 0 for false and laws like $x^2=x$). By *“establish[ing] the science of Logic and construct[ing] its method” in a mathematical form* ([An Investigation of the Laws of Thought by George Boole | Blurb Books](https://www.blurb.com/b/5468915-an-investigation-of-the-laws-of-thought#:~:text=symbolic%20language%20of%20mathematics%20to,nature%20of%20the%20human%20mind)), Boole’s book became the foundation of modern digital logic and theoretical computer science.

- **1879 – Gottlob Frege, *Begriffsschrift* (Logic/Mathematics):** Frege’s *Begriffsschrift* (“Concept-Script”) introduced the first rigorously formal **predicate logic**. In this 1879 booklet, Frege developed a symbolic logic with quantified variables and logical connectives – essentially creating modern quantificational logic ([Frege's Logic - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege-logic/#:~:text=Friedrich%20Ludwig%20Gottlob%20Frege%20%28b,quantificational%20logic%20in%20his%20Begriffsschrift)). The calculus in *Begriffsschrift* included the **first appearance of quantified variables** and allowed reasoning about predicates and relations with an unprecedented precision ([Begriffsschrift - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begriffsschrift#:~:text=The%20calculus%20contains%20the%20first,1)). This invention of a formal logical language for “pure thought” enabled later work in the foundations of mathematics (logicism) and earned Frege credit as the inventor of modern logic.

- **1874/1883 – Georg Cantor, *Foundations of Set Theory* (Mathematics):** Through a series of papers (1874–1883), Cantor founded **set theory** and introduced the concept of transfinite numbers. In 1874 he made the “revolutionary discovery” that the set of real numbers is *uncountably* infinite ([Cantor's first set theory article - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_first_set_theory_article#:~:text=One%20of%20these%20theorems%20is,This%20theorem%20is%20proved)) – proving that some infinities (the reals) are strictly larger than others (the naturals). He later developed the hierarchy of infinite cardinal numbers and proved the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem. Cantor’s 1883 treatise *Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mengenlehre* organized these results, establishing that infinite sets have an “increasing sequence of larger and larger infinite cardinalities” ([Set Theory | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/set-theo/#:~:text=Set%20Theory%20,In)). This work opened up a new domain of mathematics (set theory) and underpins all of modern mathematics via set-theoretic foundations.

*(Additional 19th-century milestone: **Karl Marx’s *Das Kapital* (Vol. I, 1867)**, which provided a foundational critique of political economy and profoundly influenced social philosophy. Marx’s analysis of capitalism (surplus value, class struggle) made *Capital* a transformative work beyond economics. However, as this timeline focuses on mathematics, logic, computer science, and philosophy, Marx’s work, while historically monumental, lies outside the main scope.)*

## 20th Century (1900s–1990s)

### Early 20th (1900s–1930s)

- **1910–1913 – Alfred N. Whitehead & Bertrand Russell, *Principia Mathematica* (Logic/Mathematics):** *Principia Mathematica* is a monumental three-volume attempt to reduce all of mathematics to pure logic. Published 1910–13, it was intended *“to lay bare the logical foundations of mathematics”* ([Principia Mathematica | Contents, Logicism, Theory of Descriptions, Bertrand Russell, & Alfred North Whitehead | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Principia-Mathematica#:~:text=Principia%20Mathematica%2C%20monumental%20work%20in,are%20definable%20in%20logical%20terms)) – showing that arithmetic, set theory, and other math could be derived from a few logical axioms (an approach later known as *logicism*). Though ultimately Gödel’s results showed the limits of this program, *Principia* revolutionized formal logic and influenced the development of computers and formal languages by formalizing large parts of mathematics with symbolic logic.

- **1921 – Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (Philosophy/Logic):** In this *“landmark work”* ([Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus | Wittgenstein, Content, Structure, Logical Atomism, Picture Theory, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus#:~:text=Tractatus%20Logico,subsequent%20development%20of%20analytic%20philosophy)) of analytic philosophy, Wittgenstein presented a terse, logically structured philosophy of language known as logical atomism. He advanced the *“picture theory of meaning”* – the idea that propositions are “pictures” of states of affairs – and famously concluded with the dictum that one must remain silent about that which cannot be spoken (the limits of language). The *Tractatus* was *“tremendously influential in the subsequent development of analytic philosophy”* ([Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus | Wittgenstein, Content, Structure, Logical Atomism, Picture Theory, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus#:~:text=Tractatus%20Logico,subsequent%20development%20of%20analytic%20philosophy)), shaping the agenda of the logical positivists and debates about language, logic, and metaphysics for decades.

- **1931 – Kurt Gödel, *On Formally Undecidable Propositions…* (Logic/Mathematics):** Gödel’s 1931 paper (originally in German) proved the **Incompleteness Theorems**, showing that any sufficiently powerful axiomatic system (like Principia’s) cannot be both complete and consistent. This work, *“which stands as a major turning point of 20th-century logic,”* demonstrated that in any such system there will be true statements unprovable within the system ([Incompleteness theorem | Gödel’s Proof, Mathematical Logic, Undecidability | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/incompleteness-theorem#:~:text=In%201931%20G%C3%B6del%20published%20his,use%20the%20%2084%20axiomatic)). Gödel’s second theorem further showed a system cannot prove its own consistency. These revelations shattered the logicist program and revealed fundamental limits to formalization, profoundly influencing mathematics, logic, and computer science (e.g. the theory of computation and computability).

### Mid 20th (1940s–1960s)

- **1944 – John von Neumann & Oskar Morgenstern, *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior* (Mathematics/Economics):** This book founded **game theory** as a field. Von Neumann and Morgenstern modeled economic and social interactions as mathematical games of strategy, introducing the minimax theorem and the concept of expected utility (the **von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function**). They argued that traditional mathematics (for passive natural phenomena) was inadequate for economics, and that economics *“is much like a game”* of strategy ([The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior | work by Morgenstern and von Neumann | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Theory-of-Games-and-Economic-Behavior#:~:text=In%20game%20theory)). By formalizing concepts like zero-sum games and Nash equilibrium (anticipated by von Neumann’s 1928 work), this 1944 treatise transformed economics and many other disciplines, from evolutionary biology to political science.

- **1948 – Claude Shannon, *A Mathematical Theory of Communication* (Computer Science/Information Theory):** Shannon’s paper created **information theory** by defining a quantitative measure of information and the fundamental limits of communication. It *“established the basic results of information theory in…complete form,”* including the notion of *entropy* (information content) and the Shannon coding theorems ([A Mathematical Theory of Communication | article by Shannon | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/A-Mathematical-Theory-of-Communication#:~:text=)). By treating communication signals *“in isolation from the meaning”* of messages ([A Mathematical Theory of Communication | article by Shannon | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/A-Mathematical-Theory-of-Communication#:~:text=In%20information%20theory%3A%20Historical%20background)), Shannon showed how to calculate channel capacity and error-correcting codes. This work earned him the title “father of information theory” and underlies all modern digital communications, from data compression to the Internet.

- **1950 – Alan Turing, *Computing Machinery and Intelligence* (Computer Science/AI):** In this influential paper, Turing directly addressed the question “Can machines think?” and proposed the **Turing Test** as a behavioral criterion for machine intelligence. He outlined the *Imitation Game* in which a computer tries to indistinguishably mimic a human’s responses. This 1950 work was *the first paper to focus exclusively on machine intelligence* ([Turing test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#:~:text=Turing%20test%20,Turing%20begins%20the%201950)) and it effectively launched artificial intelligence as a field. Turing discussed objections and predicted future advances, laying a philosophical groundwork that shaped AI research and popular conceptions of AI.

- **1957 – Noam Chomsky, *Syntactic Structures* (Linguistics/Computer Science):** Chomsky’s slender 1957 book was a **revolution in linguistics**, introducing *transformational-generative grammar*. It is *“widely recognized for its radical reconception of grammar as a mathematically precise system of recursive rules,”* capable of generating an infinite number of sentences ([Syntactic Structures | Contents, Transformational Grammar, Examples, Cognitive Revolution, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Syntactic-Structures#:~:text=Syntactic%20Structures%2C%20foundational%20work%20of,the%20cognitive%20revolution%20demonstrated%20that)). Chomsky argued that the ability to acquire language is innate to the human mind (launching the “cognitive revolution”) and that languages have deep structural similarities. In addition to reshaping linguistics, this work’s formal approach to grammar led to the **Chomsky hierarchy** in computer science (a classification of formal languages) and influenced the development of programming language theory and compiler design.

- **1962 – Thomas S. Kuhn, *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* (Philosophy of Science):** Kuhn’s *Structure* introduced the now-famous concept of **paradigm shifts** in the development of science. He argued that scientific research operates within reigning *“paradigms”* – accepted theories, methods, and assumptions – and that progress happens via periodic revolutions where an existing paradigm is replaced by a new one ([The Structure of Scientific Revolutions | work by Kuhn | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Structure-of-Scientific-Revolutions#:~:text=In%20his%20landmark%20second%20book%2C,scope%20by%20refining%20theories%2C%20explaining%E2%80%A6)) ([The Structure of Scientific Revolutions | work by Kuhn | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Structure-of-Scientific-Revolutions#:~:text=In%20philosophy%20of%20science%3A%20The,work%20of%20Thomas%20Kuhn)). Normal science is puzzle-solving within a paradigm, whereas crises lead to extraordinary science and paradigm change. This analysis (illustrated with examples like the Copernican revolution) *“was one of the most influential books”* in postwar history of science ([The Structure of Scientific Revolutions | work by Kuhn | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Structure-of-Scientific-Revolutions#:~:text=In%20historiography%3A%20History%20of%20science)). Kuhn’s notions of *“normal science”* vs. *“revolutionary science”* and *“paradigm shift”* have since entered the general vocabulary, profoundly affecting how we view scientific progress and even change in many other domains.

### Late 20th (1970s–1990s)

- **1970 – Edgar F. Codd, *“A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks”* (Computer Science):** In this 1970 paper, Codd introduced the **relational database model**, radically transforming how data is stored and accessed. He proposed that data be organized in tables (relations) with rows and columns, and manipulated through a high-level language (which led to SQL). This paper is regarded as *“one of the most influential in computer science… an extraordinarily influential paper that created the entire framework for relational databases”* ([Database Design and Administration → Introduction to SQL - Servoy University](https://www.servoyu.com/courses/database-design-and-administration/lessons/introduction-to-sql/#:~:text=what%20we%20now%20call%20the,we%20learned%20this%20is%20that)). Virtually all modern databases trace their theoretical foundation to Codd’s work, which made data management more flexible and rigorously grounded in mathematical set theory and logic.

- **1971 – John Rawls, *A Theory of Justice* (Philosophy):** Rawls’s magnum opus rejuvenated political and moral philosophy by articulating *“justice as fairness.”* It developed a non-utilitarian, social-contract-based justification of a liberal democratic order *“characterized by fairness, equality, and individual rights.”* Rawls famously used the thought experiment of the “original position” behind a “veil of ignorance” to derive two principles of justice (equal basic liberties, and socio-economic inequalities arranged to benefit the least advantaged). Published in 1971, it quickly became *“the most influential work of liberal political philosophy of the twentieth century,”* establishing Rawls as *“widely considered the most important political philosopher of the 20th century.”* ([A Theory of Justice | work by Rawls | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/A-Theory-of-Justice#:~:text=In%20John%20Rawls)) 

- **1971 – Stephen Cook, *“The Complexity of Theorem-Proving Procedures”* (Computer Science):** This landmark paper introduced the concept of **NP-complete** problems, launching theoretical computer science’s study of computational complexity. Cook proved (independently also proven by Leonid Levin) that the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is NP-complete – meaning every problem in NP can be polynomial-time reduced to SAT ([Cook–Levin theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%E2%80%93Levin_theorem#:~:text=In%20computational%20complexity%20theory%2C%20the,complete)). This result, now called the Cook–Levin Theorem, identified a large class of seemingly intractable problems and defined NP-completeness. It brought the *P vs NP* question into focus and showed *“that any NP problem can be converted in polynomial time”* to a single canonical problem ([[PDF] NP-Completeness and Cook's Theorem](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/propm/papers/Cook.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20NP,SAT%2C%20the%20Satisfiability%20Problem)), thereby unifying a vast range of difficult problems under one complexity-theoretic framework that remains hugely influential in computing, mathematics, and optimization.

- **1980 – Saul Kripke, *Naming and Necessity* (Philosophy):** Kripke’s book (based on lectures from 1970, published 1980) revolutionized analytic philosophy’s understanding of language and metaphysics. *Naming and Necessity* challenged the descriptivist theory of names (Frege-Russell) by arguing that names are **rigid designators** that refer directly to the same object in every possible world. Kripke introduced modal logic semantics to philosophy of language and revived essentialism by distinguishing between *necessity* and *a priori*. This work *“changed the course of analytic philosophy,”* overthrowing previous doctrines ([Naming and Necessity | work by Kripke - Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Naming-and-Necessity#:~:text=Naming%20and%20Necessity%20,the%20course%20of%20analytic%20philosophy)). It had broad impact, giving rise to new theories of reference (direct reference theory), modal metaphysics, and influencing fields from cognitive science to linguistics.

- **1989 – Tim Berners-Lee, *“Information Management: A Proposal”* (Computer Science):** In March 1989, Berners-Lee circulated an internal CERN proposal outlining a *“networked hypertext system”* to manage and retrieve information across different computers ([Web at 25: Tim Berners-Lee's Amazing Proposal Document | TIME](https://time.com/21039/tim-berners-lee-web-proposal-at-25/#:~:text=Nuclear%20Research%2C%20in%20Geneva,to%20manage%20all%20that%20knowledge)). This modest document – intended to help scientists share data – became the blueprint for the **World Wide Web**. Berners-Lee proposed using hypertext (linked documents) and a distributed architecture, *“bringing together technologies and concepts his colleagues already knew”* (like URLs, HTML, HTTP) into an integrated system ([Web at 25: Tim Berners-Lee's Amazing Proposal Document | TIME](https://time.com/21039/tim-berners-lee-web-proposal-at-25/#:~:text=Berners,brilliant%20Mac%20software%20HyperCard%2C%20whose)). By 1990–91 the Web was prototyped, and soon it spread globally. Berners-Lee’s proposal, with its vision of universal linkable information, has scaled to reshape modern society, making the Web one of the greatest innovations of the late 20th century.

## 21st Century (2000s)

- **2008 – Satoshi Nakamoto, *“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”* (Computer Science/Cryptography):** This white paper introduced **Bitcoin**, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, and with it the **blockchain** concept. Nakamoto described a system for electronic transactions that does not rely on trust in a central authority, but instead uses a distributed ledger (blockchain) secured by proof-of-work. The paper solved the double-spending problem via a peer-to-peer network and hash-based proof-of-work, creating digital scarcity. Published online in 2008, it led to the launch of Bitcoin in 2009 and a revolution in finance and computer science – spawning thousands of cryptocurrencies and inspiring applications of blockchain technology far beyond digital cash (from smart contracts to decentralized organizations) ([Bitcoin - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#:~:text=On%2031%20October%202008%2C%20a,posted%20to%20a%20cryptography)).

*(Additional 21st-century context: In 2002–2003, **Grigori Perelman** posted proofs of the Poincaré Conjecture, solving a century-old problem in topology and exemplifying the power of 21st-century collaborative verification. In 2013, the *Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) Book* proposed a new univalent foundation for mathematics, blending type theory and homotopy theory to reimagine the underpinnings of math. These and other works show that foundational and transformative contributions continue in the 21st century. However, many such contributions (e.g. in AI and quantum computing) are incremental or in essay form rather than singular “landmark texts.” The Bitcoin paper stands out as a singular, widely impactful 21st-century text.)*

<br>

**Conclusion:** From the 17th-century scientific method of Bacon and the analytic geometry of Descartes, through the logical foundations laid by Frege and Russell, the computational paradigms of Turing and Shannon, and the socio-philosophical shifts of Rawls and Kuhn, each work in this timeline marks a transformative step. These texts collectively map the evolution of modern thought across mathematics, logic, computer science, and philosophy – each *foundational* in its own discipline, and many with effects that spilled over into the others, shaping the intellectual landscape we inhabit today.
