Amazing. I’ll begin a deep, thematic, longform synthesis of Nicole Oresme’s entire body of work — across science, philosophy, economics, and politics — in the style of a journalistic essay. I’ll quote directly from primary texts where possible, integrate academic commentary, and organize everything thematically rather than chronologically. The focus will remain strictly within Oresme’s own framework, avoiding modern reinterpretation, and the tone will be akin to a New Yorker long-read — immersive, paragraph-by-paragraph, and textually grounded.

I’ll let you know when the essay is ready for review.

# The Many Dimensions of Nicole Oresme

## A Scholar at Court in a World of Change  
In the late 1370s, a richly illuminated manuscript shows a French king commissioning a translation. In one panel, King Charles V gestures from his throne, instructing a learned cleric at his feet. In the next, that cleric – **Nicole Oresme** – returns bearing a hefty book, accompanied by attendants, to present the freshly translated wisdom of Aristotle to the crown ([Livre de Politiques - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livre_de_Politiques#:~:text=ImageMiniature%20from%20the%20prologue%20of,the%20book%20to%20Charles%20V)). It is a scene of intellectual pageantry: the scholar delivering ancient knowledge in the vernacular tongue of France. Nicole Oresme, theologian and natural philosopher, was by then not only the king’s adviser but also the **bishop of Lisieux**, a man equally at home in the University of Paris and the royal court. He lived in a world on the cusp of transition – a medieval cosmos of fixed stars and allegiances, yet one where new questions stirred about motion, currency, language, and the order of the heavens. Oresme’s writings are remarkable for how they **bridge disparate worlds**: Latin scholasticism and French courtly culture, abstract theory and practical governance, Aristotelian tradition and quietly revolutionary insight. 

Oresme’s **intellectual journey** carried him from Normandy to the College of Navarre in Paris, and ultimately into the confidence of a reform-minded king. Along the way, he produced an astonishing range of works: **mathematical treatises** on ratios and motions, searching **commentaries on Aristotle** (not just in Latin for fellow scholars but in French for lay princes), a seminal **treatise on money** and economic justice, forthright **attacks on astrology and superstition**, and elegant **translations** of Aristotle’s *Ethics*, *Politics*, and *On the Heavens* with original glosses. To read Oresme is to enter a *thematic universe* where ideas of **motion**, **time**, **mathematics**, **cosmic order**, **language**, and **moral governance** all intersect. He does not simply enumerate doctrines; he grapples with them, often in an immersive, conversational tone – as if reasoning his way through each problem for the reader. In what follows, we explore *Nicole Oresme’s world from the inside*, tracing a set of recurring themes that preoccupied this 14th-century polymath. From the geometry of qualities to the nature of time, from the music of the spheres to the perils of debased coin and corrupted power, Oresme’s works form a rich tapestry of thought – **deeply medieval in form, yet often startlingly innovative in content**. Each section of this essay will delve into one facet of his oeuvre, drawing heavily on Oresme’s own words (Latin or French) to illuminate how he understood his world. It is a journey through an intellectual landscape as finely textured and vivid as a painted manuscript, guided by the keen mind of Nicole Oresme himself.

## Mapping Motion and Qualities: The Geometry of the Intangible  
One of Oresme’s most striking contributions emerged from a simple but powerful question: *how can we understand things that change – qualities, speeds, intensities – with the precision of geometry or arithmetic?* In the mid-14th century, scholars at Paris and Oxford were wrestling with the “quantification of qualities,” devising ways to describe qualities (like heat, density, or velocity) that grow or diminish. Oresme took this to a new level of abstraction and clarity. In his *Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum* (“Treatise on the Configuration of Qualities and Motions”), written around 1350, he introduces a bold visual metaphor: **any varying quality can be depicted as a geometrical figure**, essentially by plotting its “intensity” along one axis over the “extent” of its subject along the other ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=originality,the%20senses%20and%20is%20aided)) ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=The%20thought%20that%20guide%20to,is%20particularly%20important%20for%20the)). As he explains in the opening chapters, “every measurable thing except numbers is imagined in the manner of a continuous quantity,” so for any quality that can change, one should imagine a perpendicular line erected to represent the magnitude of the quality at each point ([Nicole Oresme - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=,equal%20lines%2C%20a%20double%20intensity)). In Oresme’s own words, *“every intensity which can be acquired successively ought to be imagined by a straight line perpendicularly erected on some point of the space or subject of the intensible thing”* ([Nicole Oresme - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=,equal%20lines%2C%20a%20double%20intensity)). Equal degrees of heat, for example, would be shown by equal line segments; twice the heat by a line twice as tall, and so on ([Nicole Oresme - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=thing%2C%20e,way%20if%20one%20proceeds%20proportionally)). By filling in these line segments along the subject’s extension (say, along a piece of iron that is hotter at one end than the other), one obtains a plane figure – a “configuration” – that faithfully represents the quality’s distribution. As Oresme notes, our minds grasp magnitudes more easily when they are made spatial: *“the quantity or ratio of lines is better known and more readily conceived by us”* than abstract intensities ([Nicole Oresme - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=which%20can%20be%20acquired%20successively,way%20if%20one%20proceeds%20proportionally)). Thus, he argues, it is perfectly sensible to represent heat, or speed, or even psychological phenomena, by the *geometry of lines and areas* ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=Oresme%20expressly%20states%20that%20the,the%20mentality%20involved%20in%20these)) ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF).

This scheme effectively creates a rudimentary coordinate system of **longitude** (the subject’s extension, be it space or time) and **latitude** (the intensity of the quality) ([Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of Qualities and Motions](https://www.amazon.com/Nicole-Medieval-Geometry-Qualities-Motions/dp/B000KQ6LOI#:~:text=In%20these%20works%20Oresme%20conceived,configurationes%29%20to)) – an astonishing foreshadowing of graphing techniques. Indeed, Oresme explicitly says his method applies “universally to every conceivable intensity, both in terms of types of qualities and subjects,” from the color in a cloth to the velocity of a moving object ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=Oresme%20expressly%20states%20that%20the,the%20mentality%20involved%20in%20these)). Centuries before Descartes, Oresme had conceived of something very much like analytic geometry: using figures to analyze variable quantities ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=However%2C%20Oresme%20has%20undoubted%20primacy,first%20steps%20in%20this%20direction)) ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=quantitative%20method%20of%20modern%20science,25)).

What did Oresme *do* with this tool? He used it to classify motions and changes with unprecedented rigor. He distinguished uniform qualities (yielding straight-line “profiles”) from difform (irregular profiles), uniform accelerations (yielding a linearly rising intensity over time, i.e. a planar figure that is a triangle) from other kinds of acceleration. In essence, Oresme could *“see”* the difference between a constant speed, a steady acceleration, and a fluctuating motion by contemplating their geometric configurations ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=This%20use%20of%20rectangular%20coordinates,Dingler%20concluded%20that%20Oresme%27s)). For example, a uniformly accelerated motion (where velocity increases in proportion to time) would produce a triangular configuration of velocity vs. time – a result Oresme knew how to relate to distances covered. Modern historians have marveled at this insight, crediting Oresme with a conceptual revolution: **to study motion “according to the requirements of mathematical physics,” one must reference motion to a temporal framework** ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=This%20use%20of%20rectangular%20coordinates,Dingler%20concluded%20that%20Oresme%27s)). By mapping velocity against time as one would a line against a baseline, Oresme made it possible to define quantities like average speed via geometry. It is no coincidence that later scholars like Galileo would employ similar reasoning about uniformly accelerated motion (Galileo’s famous area-law of acceleration is essentially present in Oresme’s configuration for uniform difformity ([Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of Qualities and Motions](https://www.amazon.com/Nicole-Medieval-Geometry-Qualities-Motions/dp/B000KQ6LOI#:~:text=In%20these%20works%20Oresme%20conceived,configurationes%29%20to))). Yet Oresme himself wears his originality lightly. In his prologue, he humbly credits those before him “who have dealt with this subject,” even as he advances beyond them ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=At%20the%20beginning%20of%20his,vertical%20line%20is%20raised%20whose)). The **breadth of phenomena** he considers measurable is breathtaking. Not only physical qualities (hotter, heavier, faster) but even things “not usually understood” as qualities – Oresme gives the example of **speed** itself – can be treated this way ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=means%20of%20a%20straight%20line,for%20the%20representation%20of%20movement)). He even suggests that psychological intensities (perhaps strength of passions or clarity of thought) could, in principle, be given a quantitative profile ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=to%20every%20conceivable%20intensity%2C%20both,apply%20the%20quantitative%20method%2C%20characteristic)). Such statements reveal a mind eager to *apply the quantitative method to an enormously broad field of phenomena* ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=Oresme%20expressly%20states%20that%20the,the%20mentality%20involved%20in%20these)), a key step toward what we consider a scientific outlook.

Nicole Oresme was also a mathematician in a more abstract sense. His *Algorismus proportionum* (Algorithm of Ratios) and related work *De proportionibus proportionum* tackled the tricky arithmetic of ratios and exponents. He was intrigued by how ratios themselves might have ratios – essentially exploring the laws of exponents (for example, the ratio of ratio A:B to ratio C:D could be seen as a power) ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=and%20scientific%20grounds,In%20modern%20terms)). Oresme was the **first to rigorously treat fractional exponents** in Europe: he showed, for instance, that raising a number to a rational power could be understood within the same framework as ordinary powers ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=and%20scientific%20grounds,In%20modern%20terms)). Pursuing an insight of the Oxford scholar Thomas Bradwardine about speeds depending on the ratio of force to resistance, Oresme generalized it – laying out how to raise a ratio to an arbitrary rational power ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=irrational%20powers,In%20modern%20terms)). In modern terms, if one asserts (as Bradwardine did) that velocity increases in proportion to the exponential of force/resistance, Oresme had the mathematical machinery to examine that claim ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=irrational%20powers,In%20modern%20terms)). This gave him a fresh way to analyze the **motions of the heavens**: by treating the periods of planets or the speeds of stars as ratios and comparing them. He came to a striking conclusion: it is **highly probable that the ratio of any two celestial motions is incommensurable**, that is, no exact common measure exists between the cycles of, say, Saturn and Jupiter ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=Oresme%20then%20asserted%20that%20the,and%20lords%20to%20whom%20appertains)). In other words, the planetary periods never sync up in a perfect repeat. This mathematical argument had profound implications (as we’ll see) for Oresme’s attitude toward astrological predictions – it was a built-in guarantee against the idea of history perfectly repeating by celestial timetable. It also prefigured a modern understanding of resonance and chaos in celestial mechanics: most pairs of orbits are indeed incommensurate. Here, as elsewhere, Nicole Oresme’s mathematical instincts pushed him to the frontier of the known. In a short proof (given in a later treatise), he even demonstrated that an infinite series of reciprocal numbers (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + …) *diverges without bound*, a subtle result not appreciated by many until much later ([Number Theory - Nicole Oresme's Proof That the Harmonic Series Diverges](https://mcadamsmath.tripod.com/numbers/oresmeharmonicseries.html#:~:text=The%20French%20mathematician%20Nicole%20Oresme,converge%2C%20then%20the%20harmonic%20series)). Oresme offered this finding in the context of a **theological discussion on the infinity of God’s power**, using it to show how infinite addition can produce an arbitrarily large result – a beautiful instance of mathematical reasoning woven into scholastic philosophy. 

Through all these investigations, Oresme remained grounded in the physical and observable. He reminds the reader that *“our knowledge relies on the senses and is aided by the imagination”* ([Nicolás Oresme Grand Master of the high school of Navarre. group Science, Reason and Faith (CRYF). University of Navarra](https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/nicolas-oresme-gran-maestre-del-colegio-de-navarra#:~:text=represented%2C%20and%20at%20each%20point,the%20imagination%20through%20resource)). That motto – empiricism reinforced by visualization – could well sum up his approach. By mapping the intangible onto lines and figures, Oresme made the unseen seen. Qualities and motions became, in his skilled imagination, as palpably measurable as a plot of land. It was an intellectual art of **mapping the invisible**. This fusion of mathematical abstraction with natural philosophy is one of Oresme’s greatest legacies. It shows a confident belief that nature’s subtle properties can be brought into the realm of human understanding without mystical residue – a belief that animates all his work, from physics to economics. 

## The Heavens in Motion: Cosmology and Celestial Order  
Like many scholastic philosophers, Oresme devoted intense study to **Aristotle’s cosmology**, the orderly system of spheres and elements described in *On the Heavens* (*De caelo*). But Oresme did far more than reiterate Aristotle. In both Latin academic questions and, boldly, a French vernacular adaptation titled *Le Livre du ciel et du monde*, he explored contentious ideas about the **cosmos** – even those Aristotle himself had deemed improbable. His approach to cosmology epitomizes his method: **respectful of received wisdom yet unafraid to test its limits**.

Oresme begins his *Livre du ciel et du monde* by praising Aristotle’s work as perhaps the most beautiful book of natural philosophy ever made: *“il n'est homme mortel qui onque veist plus bel ne meilleur livre de philosophie naturele que est cestui”* – there has never been a more excellent book of natural philosophy, he declares, neither in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, Latin, nor “en françois” ([THE WRITINGS OF NICOLE ORESME: A SYSTEMATIC INVENTORY | Traditio | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/traditio/article/writings-of-nicole-oresme-a-systematic-inventory/A968668558A2CEACBE5BEA4B325BBE35#:~:text=sciences%2C%20je%2C%20Nychole%20Oresme%2C%20doien,%E2%80%9D)). This lavish praise, placed in the prologue at the request of *“tres souverain et tres excellent prince Charles quint”* (the very sovereign Prince Charles V who ordered the translation) ([THE WRITINGS OF NICOLE ORESME: A SYSTEMATIC INVENTORY | Traditio | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/traditio/article/writings-of-nicole-oresme-a-systematic-inventory/A968668558A2CEACBE5BEA4B325BBE35#:~:text=Incipit%20and%20explicit%20,ou%20qualit%C3%A9z%2C%20et%20de%20leurs)), situates Oresme firmly as Aristotle’s expositor. Yet soon after immersing himself in Aristotle’s text, Oresme does something remarkable: he entertains the **possibility that Aristotle may have been wrong** about a fundamental point – the stability of the Earth. In Aristotle’s cosmology, the Earth sits immobile at the center of the universe while the heavens rotate around it daily. This had been doctrine for centuries. But in Book II, chapter 25 of *De caelo*, Aristotle alludes to an alternate theory (attributed to the ancient Heraclides of Pontus and even hinted in Plato’s *Timaeus*): what if the Earth itself rotates once a day, while the heavens remain still ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=Text%3A%20And%20some%20say%20the,as%20written%20in%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20Timaeus))? Aristotle quickly dismisses this, but Oresme seizes on it. In his commentary (given in French in *Le Livre du ciel*), Oresme writes that Aristotle perhaps thought such ideas had “little root in appearance” and thus didn’t bother to refute them here ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=Timaeus)). Then Oresme pointedly adds: *“But it seems to me, subject to correction, that one could well support and give lustre to the last opinion, namely that the earth, and not the heavens, is moved with a daily movement.”* ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=Gloss%3A%20This%20was%20the%20opinion,elsewhere%20in%20philosophy%20and%20astronomy)) In other words, let’s seriously consider that the Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours.

What follows is a tour de force of **medieval scientific reasoning**. Oresme systematically addresses the common objections to a rotating Earth. First, he says, **no observation can prove** the heavens move rather than the Earth ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=But%20it%20seems%20to%20me%2C,diurnal%20rotation%20of%20the%20earth)). The rising and setting of sun and stars – our senses tell us these bodies move, but *“one could not demonstrate the contrary by any experience,”* he insists ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=luster%20to%20the%20last%20opinion%2C,diurnal%20rotation%20of%20the%20earth)). To illustrate this relativity of motion, Oresme offers a now-famous thought experiment: imagine two ships, A and B, out on the ocean ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=3,him%20that%20b%20is%20moved)). If you stand on ship A and only see ship B, there is no absolute way to tell which ship is moving. If B glides by, you might just as well think B is moving and A is still – and if the roles reverse an hour later (A moves, B still), you would perceive no change, still thinking B moves ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=respect%20in%20the%20same%20manner,him%20that%20b%20is%20moved)). *“This is apparent by experience,”* Oresme notes – any voyager knows the feeling of a stationary ship making others seem in motion, or vice versa ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=,This%20is)). Thus, if we on Earth are like observers on one ship and the starry firmament is another ship, it will *always* look to us as though the other (the heavens) is doing the moving ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=of%20the%20two%20parts%20of,distinctly%20and%20its%20mountains%2C%20valleys)) ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=was%20at%20rest%20and%20that,moved%20with%20a%20diurnal%20movement)). We could not, by any sensory evidence, know if instead the Earth was spinning and the heavens actually still. *“I conclude that one could not by any experience whatsoever demonstrate that the heavens, and not the earth, are moved with a diurnal motion,”* Oresme writes, wrapping up this part of the argument ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=arrow%2C%20as%20was%20said,moved%20with%20a%20diurnal%20motion)).

Next he tackles the **physical objections**. Wouldn’t a spinning Earth cause a perpetual mighty wind as the air was left behind? No, says Oresme – the air close to Earth would be **carried along** by the Earth’s rotation, just as the atmosphere inside a moving ship travels with the ship ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=4,with%20this%20trajection%20it)) ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=5,hand%20was%20moved%20with%20rectilinear)). We do not feel a constant east wind because the entire “element of air” near the ground is moving in unison with Earth. What about objects thrown straight up – wouldn’t a rotating Earth leave them falling behind? Oresme answers with essentially the principle of inertia and relative motion: the arrow shot into the air is moving eastward *together with the air and the Earth* as it flies ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=5,hand%20was%20moved%20with%20rectilinear)) ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=that%20the%20arrow%20is%20trajected,diurnal%20rotation%20of%20the%20earth)). Thus it lands back at the same spot on Earth, just as it would on a stationary Earth. He gives a concrete analogy: on a swiftly moving ship, someone who leaps straight up, or drops an object from the mast, does not see the ship deck race away beneath them; the moving frame carries the object along ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=earth%20from%20which%20it%20left,)). Likewise, a person moving inside a ship can have an apparent motion opposite to the ship’s motion (an early hint at composition of velocities) ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=,consistent%20with%20a%20stationary%20earth)), but everything still “seems consistent with a stationary” ship to those on board ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=would%20seem%20to%20him%20that,consistent%20with%20a%20stationary%20earth)). Oresme even invokes Aristotle’s own ideas about how a flame rising in air is carried west-east by the daily motion of the heavens – turning that around to imagine the flame carried if the air itself were rotating ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=natural%20example%20verified%20by%20Aristotle,daily%20movement%2C%20it%20is%20apparent)). In short, **Oresme neutralizes each physical argument against a moving Earth**. By the end of his analysis, he has effectively shown that the geocentric and the rotational hypotheses are *observationally and physically indistinguishable*. He emphasizes that anyone “with good intelligence” can easily imagine the scenario and see that all phenomena would appear the same ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=of%20the%20two%20parts%20of,distinctly%20and%20its%20mountains%2C%20valleys)) ([Nicole Oresme on the Book of the Heavens and the World of Aristotle – Robert Hatch](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/2022/07/28/nicole-oresme-on-the-book-of-the-heavens-and-the-world-of-aristotle/#:~:text=was%20at%20rest%20and%20that,moved%20with%20a%20diurnal%20movement)).

Having removed the negatives, Oresme even finds *positive* reasons for a rotating Earth. It is, he notes, far simpler and more “economical” to have one body (the Earth) spin once a day than to make the vast heavens and all the stars whirl around at enormous speed ([Nicole Oresme and the Moving Earth - Quodlibeta](https://bedejournal.blogspot.com/2010/01/nicole-oresme-and-moving-earth.html#:~:text=Nicole%20Oresme%20and%20the%20Moving,other%20celestial%20sphere%20do)). Here he echoes a principle of simplicity that later thinkers like Copernicus would also cite – a medieval form of Occam’s Razor applied to cosmology. Oresme knew that **John Buridan**, his likely teacher at Paris, had made similar arguments a few decades earlier, suggesting that God could as easily make the Earth rotate as make the heavens do so, and that we cannot tell the difference ([Nicole Oresme - Linda Hall Library](https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=Nicole%20Oresme%20,would%20land%20far%20to)). Oresme carries this line of thought forward with confidence and clarity. He even addresses the scriptural issue: some might object that the Bible says “the Earth stands firm.” But Oresme, as a clergyman, argues that such phrases need not be literal physics in a context where sensory appearances were being described (an approach later echoed by Copernicus and Galileo). In the end, after piling up reasons **in favor of Earth’s rotation**, Oresme steps back from the brink of open heliocentrism. In the concluding part of his book, he reminds the reader that while reason cannot prove Earth is static, *faith and literal authority still favor the traditional view*. He personally affirms his belief that Earth *is* stationary, largely out of deference to Scripture and Aristotle ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=stars,Aristotelian%20tenet%20of%20a%20single)). *“Although Oresme showed the possibility of a daily axial rotation of the Earth, he finished by affirming his belief in a stationary Earth,”* as one historian summarizes ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=stars,Aristotelian%20tenet%20of%20a%20single)). It was as if Oresme felt he had exercised a scholastic quaestio to its limits – testing one’s opponent’s position to the fullest – and then ultimately returned to orthodoxy. But in doing so, he bequeathed to posterity a **complete demonstration that geocentrism was not logically necessary**, that an Earth in motion was as conceivable as an Earth at rest.

Oresme did not stop at this daring thought experiment. In the same breath, he examined the question of **other worlds** beyond our own. Could God have made multiple worlds, multiple separate universes each with its own Earth? Aristotle had argued vehemently for a single cosmos – a cornerstone of his natural philosophy – but medieval theologians were free to imagine that God’s omnipotence might allow many worlds. Oresme proves the *logical possibility* of a plurality of worlds (there is no inherent contradiction in God creating another whole cosmos), even though, once again, he keeps “the Aristotelian tenet of a single cosmos” as the likely reality ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=stars,Aristotelian%20tenet%20of%20a%20single)). His reasoning pokes holes in Aristotle’s objections one by one. For instance, Aristotle said if there were two worlds, each would have a naturally central Earth – but two “centers” of gravity make no sense when each claims to be the center of *all* matter. Oresme replies that in a separate world, the physics could be self-contained: each world’s matter gravitates to its own center, and these centers do not compete because the worlds are not contiguous. In effect, he formulates a **self-sufficient physics for each possible world**. This thought experiment, like the rotating Earth, was not an outright advocacy for multiple universes, but it demonstrates Oresme’s willingness to **question Aristotelian dogma** using reason and imagination. In one poignant passage of his French *Livre du ciel*, Oresme muses that *God could make “several places and several worlds” if He wished, even though we have no evidence that He did* ([The Existence of Other Worlds is Possible - Inters.org](https://inters.org/Nicolas-Oresme-commentary-aristotle#:~:text=The%20Existence%20of%20Other%20Worlds,declarations%20addressed%20to%20the)). Ultimately, Oresme sides with the uniqueness of our world – not least because the unity of the cosmos better suits the theological idea of a single Creator and a coherent creation. But the mere fact that he opened these questions shows the *intellectual freedom* he carved out within scholasticism.

In Oresme’s cosmology, we also find intriguing hints of a concept of **space** more modern than Aristotle’s. Aristotle defined a body’s *place* as the inner surface of the body surrounding it (essentially the shape of the container touching it). Oresme, however, argued for a more absolute idea: the place of a body is the *space occupied by the body itself*. In his commentary on Aristotle’s *Physics*, Oresme wrote that place is essentially the three-dimensional extension a body fills – a view “non-Aristotelian” and closer to what we’d call volume or absolute space ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=rejected%20Aristotle%E2%80%99s%20definition%20of%20place,c)) ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=non,2000%2C%20126%E2%80%93138%3B%20Robert%202012%2C%2079%E2%80%9382)). This puts him in line with a minority of medieval thinkers who envisioned something like an infinite void or an infinite space beyond the finite cosmos. Indeed, Oresme elsewhere muses about an *“extracosmic void”* – an infinite, empty space outside the sphere of fixed stars ([Nicole Oresme - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=Oresme%27s%20conception%20of%20an%20extracosmic,du%20monde%2C%20Questiones%20super)). While Aristotle denied any void or any space outside the one cosmos, Oresme’s conception allowed him to imagine the universe differently: if the celestial sphere did not exist or God chose to move the whole heaven freely, there would simply be empty space beyond or between – a bold notion at the time. 

All these insights were conveyed not only in Latin to fellow scholars, but – crucially – in Oresme’s French book for the king. One must picture Oresme in the 1370s, preparing to hand King Charles a beautifully copied *Livre du ciel et du monde*, containing both the straightforward translation of Aristotle and lengthy *glosses* in which Oresme carries out these debates. It is a mark of the confidence Charles V placed in him that such speculative content was acceptable. Indeed, at the end of Book I of the *Livre du ciel*, Oresme even inserted a **small essay debunking astrology**, as if foreshadowing the battle he would wage against the misuse of celestial knowledge. To Oresme, understanding the **true nature of the heavens** – their motions, their possible infinitude, their physical reality – was deeply connected to freeing people from false beliefs about stars governing their fate. The heavens, in his view, declared the glory of God and the harmony of creation, but *not* the day-to-day destiny of kings and commoners. This brings us to another theme in Oresme’s thought: his vigorous rejection of astrology and superstition.

## The Heavens, Not the Heavens: Oresme’s Crusade Against Astrology and Marvels  
In the vibrant courts of 14th-century France, **astrology** held considerable sway. King Charles V himself kept astrologers and was known to consult star-charts for guidance, as did many princes of the age. Nicole Oresme, as a cleric and scholar, grew increasingly concerned that this fashion for horoscopes and planetary prophecies posed both spiritual and practical dangers. He saw astrology – specifically the *judicial astrology* that claimed to predict human affairs from the stars – as a kind of learned fraud, one that could corrupt the judgment of rulers and violate the freedom of human will. In the year 1356, with France in crisis after King John II’s capture in the Hundred Years’ War, Oresme took a bold step: he composed a treatise in the French language for the Dauphin (the future Charles V) entitled *Livre de divinacions* (“Book of Divinations”). This vernacular treatise, along with a Latin companion text (*Tractatus contra astronomos judiciarios* – “Treatise Against Judicial Astronomers”), amounted to a **comprehensive indictment of astrology**. Oresme warns his royal reader that nothing is more ruinous for a prince than to govern by the stars. Astrology, he writes, is *“most dangerous to those of high estate, such as princes and lords to whom appertains the government of the commonwealth”* ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=successively%20repeating%20conjunctions%2C%20oppositions%2C%20and,occult%20and%20%E2%80%9Cmarvelous%E2%80%9D%20phenomena%20by)). It seduces rulers into fatalistic or greedy decisions, and saps their faith in divine Providence and in their own reason. In a later recollection, Oresme even says he wrote against astrology *precisely because the king and his court were addicted to these practices* ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=dangerous%20to%20those%20of%20high,Panzica%202021%2C%202)) ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=explaining%20them%20in%20terms%20of,but%2C%20quite%20the%20contrary%2C%20adheres)). He was, in essence, performing an intervention through scholarship.

What were Oresme’s main arguments against astrology? Some were **theological**: the future, especially human moral actions, belongs to God’s knowledge alone, and to claim predictive certainty is to arrogate divine power. Some arguments were **moral**: believing the stars unalterably decree events undermines human free will and responsibility (a point earlier made by Augustine and reiterated by Oresme). But Oresme also deployed **scientific and logical arguments** with exceptional rigor. He pointed out the many failed predictions and contradictions within astrology. He emphasized the complexity of causal chains from stars to earthly events – how could distant Jupiter guarantee the outcome of a battle, given all the immediate physical and human factors at play? Most originally, Oresme used his mastery of mathematics to strike at astrology’s celestial mechanics. Recall his finding that the cycles of planets are likely incommensurable (no common period). From this,## The Heavens, Not the Heavens: Oresme’s Crusade Against Astrology and Marvels  
In Nicole Oresme’s intellectual universe, few enemies loomed larger than **astrology** – not astronomy, which he loved, but the extravagant claims that stars and planets dictate human fortunes. As a court cleric, Oresme saw Charles V and other nobles enthralled by astrologers. He resolved to fight this “false science” on both religious and scientific grounds. In 1356, addressing the future Charles V, he composed the *Livre de divinacions* in French (with a parallel Latin treatise, *Tractatus contra astronomos judiciarios*), a systematic demolition of astrological divination. He begins by warning that astrology is *“most dangerous to those of high estate, such as princes and lords to whom appertains the government of the commonwealth”*. A ruler led astray by horoscopes might delay needed action or perpetrate injustice, all in thrall to a clockwork fate written in the stars. Oresme marshals an arsenal of arguments. The **moral**: belief in astrological destiny undermines free will and accountability. The **theological**: it borders on heresy to claim foreknowledge of the future reserved to God. And crucially, the **scientific**: astrologers’ predictions don’t withstand rational scrutiny. 

Oresme leverages his mastery of **astronomy and mathematics** to undercut their premises. In his mathematical studies, he had developed the concept of incommensurable ratios and applied this to time cycles. He argued it was highly probable that the day, the month, and the year have no exact common measure – that is, the Earth’s rotation and orbital period, and the Moon’s orbit, are *incommensurate*. As a result, the **planetary configurations never repeat in exactly the same way** ([Nicole Oresme - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=In%20his%20mathematical%20work%2C%20Oresme,the%20claims%20of%20astrologers%20who)). There will never be a perfect recurrence of the heavens as they were on some past date. This strikes at the heart of astrological lore: if no alignment returns *exactly*, how can one reliably predict the return of identical influences? *“Planetary conjunctions and oppositions would never recur in quite exactly the same way,”* Oresme notes, and therefore astrologers who think *“they know with punctual exactness the motions, aspects, conjunctions and oppositions [of the heavens]”* are *“judg[ing] rashly and erroneously about future events.”* ([Nicole Oresme - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=made%20probabilistic%2C%20statistical%20arguments%20as,15)) Oresme even points out the **zodiac** itself has shifted over centuries (due to the precession of Earth’s axis), so that astrologers who still assign positions by old star charts are fundamentally off ([Nicole Oresme - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=Aristotelian%20%20fluids%20of%20the,three%20parts%20are%20what%20Oresme)). Throughout his treatise, he distinguishes legitimate **astronomy** – which for Oresme is a modest, inexact science of heavenly motions – from astrology’s pretense of **precise prediction**. The former he respects; the latter he derides. He cites practical experience: *farmers and sailors predict weather better than astrologers* ([Nicole Oresme - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=Aristotelian%20%20fluids%20of%20the,three%20parts%20are%20what%20Oresme)), because their knowledge is grounded in observation, not in dubious star lore. 

Oresme’s assault on astrology also involved explaining away the very things that gave astrology popular credibility: strange coincidences and seemingly “magical” phenomena. In a later work, *De causis mirabilium* (“On the Causes of Marvels,” c.1370), he becomes a proto-skeptic, seeking natural explanations for events that people call marvels. *“People marvel at things only because they rarely happen,”* he writes, *“but the causes for these are as apparent as for others.”* A person who is fearful and imagines demons will, seeing a shadowy wolf at night, *“immediately assert that it is an enemy or a devil”*, whereas a devout ecstatic might see an animal and *“judge that it is an angel.”* In reality, the wolf is just a wolf – only *“a vigorous imagining… together with a small external appearance”* have produced these illusions. With such examples, Oresme urges that many alleged portents, hauntings or apparitions are products of the human mind under stress or ignorance. Similarly, he attributes miraculous healings or calamities to natural causes and chance, stripping away the aura of astrological necessity. His aim was to show that **Nature is orderly and sufficient**: we need not invoke celestial intelligences or occult forces to explain comets, plagues, or personal misfortunes. Where others might see a comet as a sign of God’s wrath or a king’s impending death, Oresme sees a bit of natural excess (a starry vapor catching fire) and warns the king not to be afraid of it. 

By the 1370s, Oresme’s anti-astrological stance is full-throated and unapologetic. In one short Latin work, pointedly titled *Ad pauca respicientes* (“For those who consider [only] a few things”), he sums up that his mathematical demonstration of the heavens’ complexity **utterly refutes astrology**. And in the *Livre de divinacions*, after dissecting astrology’s six “parts” (from weather prediction to nativities), he concludes most of it is either useless or fraudulent. He allows that celestial bodies have some influence on the elements – for instance, the Moon on tides, the Sun on warmth – but **not** a deterministic sway over human destiny ([Nicole Oresme - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=Oresme%27s%20critique%20of%20astrology%20,17)) ([Nicole Oresme - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=and%20argues%20that%20the%20effect,good)). In fact, Oresme suggests any correspondences might be *symbolic* (as in, God could have arranged stars as signs, not causes) ([Nicole Oresme - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#:~:text=Oresme%27s%20critique%20of%20astrology%20,17)). But to assume a mechanical fate from the stars is to fall into error. It is a measure of his conviction that Oresme chose to write his polemics in French as well as Latin. One biographer notes that he first composed his arguments in learned Latin, *“but so strong was his desire to divert people from [this] false science”* that he immediately rendered them in the common tongue for wider reach. Here, once again, we see Nicole Oresme the translator and popularizer, determined to bring truth to light even outside the university halls. To Oresme’s mind, astrology was a pernicious kind of **language abuse** – a pseudo-scientific jargon that bewitched minds and clouded understanding. His cure was to expose its fallacies with plain reason, sound science, and clear language. If the stars had any message, it was the glory of God’s creation, not a cryptogram of mortal futures. And if the people needed guidance, they would get far better counsel from Oresme’s own works – on ethics, politics, and economics – than from an astrologer’s almanac.

## Money, Morals, and the Common Good  
At the French court, Nicole Oresme was not only a philosopher but also an economist avant la lettre. The 14th century saw rampant **currency manipulation** – French kings repeatedly debased the coinage (reducing silver content) to pocket profits, sowing chaos in the economy. Oresme witnessed the social misery and distrust this caused: prices skyrocketing, merchants balking at unstable coin, common folk impoverished by stealthy inflation. In response, he wrote what is often considered the **first rigorous treatise on money** in medieval Europe. His *Tractatus de mutationibus monetarum* (c.1360), soon translated into French as the *Traictié de la première invention des monnoies*, lays out a comprehensive philosophy of money and justice. Oresme starts from first principles – literally the *“first invention of money”*. Drawing on Aristotle, he explains that money was created as a medium of exchange for the **common benefit of human community**, a standard to avoid the inconveniences of barter. As such, **money belongs fundamentally to the community** that uses it, not to any one person. The ruler, even though his image might be stamped on coins, is more a **guardian or manager** of the currency than its owner. 

From this principle, Oresme derives a powerful argument against arbitrary currency debasement. If money belongs to the community, then *“whatever loss the prince inflicts on the community”* by altering its value is **injustice**. When a king recalls coins and remints them with less silver, putting the difference in his treasury, he effectively **robs his people**. Oresme does not mince words: *“I am of the opinion that the main and final cause why the prince pretends to the power of altering the coinage is the profit or gain which he can get from it,”* he writes. And that gain is ill-gotten. In Oresme’s economic ethics, a prince may **change the coin’s value only for a grave, legitimate reason** – for example, to prevent a greater harm or meet an extraordinary expense for the *common good*. To do so capriciously or for luxury is tyrannical. Oresme systematically dismantles the justifications kings gave for debasement. They argued it was their royal prerogative, or that it stimulated trade or brought specie into the realm. Oresme counters that a stable currency is the lifeblood of a healthy economy, and that trust, not trickery, enriches a realm. *Besides,* he notes shrewdly, *any temporary profit the prince makes is exactly equal to the people’s loss* – a zero-sum swindle that ultimately harms the whole realm. His conclusion is drawn with moral gravity: tampering with currency for profit is **a form of tyranny**.

Nicole Oresme extends this argument to a general philosophy of just rulership. In one memorable passage, he links the fate of tyrants to the debasement of coin: *“Whenever kingship approaches tyranny it is near its end, for by this it becomes ripe for division, change of dynasty, or total destruction.”* A ruler who abuses his power over money shows himself to be a tyrant rather than a true king, and **tyranny carries the seeds of its own demise**. This warning is not idle speculation; it is informed by Oresme’s observation of history and contemporary events. France in Oresme’s lifetime experienced popular uprisings – the Jacquerie, urban revolts – born of desperation and anger at noble and royal exactions. Oresme saw clearly that a **break of trust** – such as a currency swindle – between king and people could unravel the polity. Thus, his monetary treatise doubles as a mirror for princes: a lesson in how **moral economics** is integral to stable governance. A good prince will treat money as a public trust, keep its value honest, and thereby uphold justice; a bad prince who treats the realm’s coin as his personal piggy bank will sooner or later face revolt or ruin. 

Oresme’s keen sense of the **common good (bien commun)** underlies all these arguments. In his works on politics (about which more in a moment), Oresme repeatedly emphasizes that the legitimacy of government rests on serving the common good, not private interest. Money, as the medium of the common good in commerce, must therefore be managed for *common* benefit. Interestingly, Oresme even entertains – only to set aside – an argument that since money belongs to the community, perhaps the community itself could alter it at will. He quickly notes that such power must be exercised rationally, not whimsically, and always with regard to reason and justice. In effect, whether it’s the king or the community, **Nature and right reason dictate that money’s value should remain stable**. Some decades before the first Renaissance treatises on economics, Oresme thus anticipates the idea that currency should not be an instrument of policy manipulation but a stable measure anchored in the natural law of fair exchange. 

The lucidity and boldness of Oresme’s monetary treatise made it influential. It was cited in reform councils and echoed by later economic thinkers. More immediately, it likely influenced King Charles V, who enacted far fewer debasements than his predecessors. The French *Traictié des monnoies*, which Oresme probably presented directly to Charles, is written in a clear, didactic French, showing again Oresme’s knack for explaining complex ideas to laymen. He gives examples, uses simple analogies (comparing currency to standards of weights and measures – which a prince should no more tamper with than, say, length or volume measures), and peppers his text with moral axioms. Always he circles back to the central ethical precept: the prince is a steward for the community. In governing money, as in governing the realm, **abuse of power is a betrayal of office**. Nicole Oresme the economist and Nicole Oresme the moral philosopher are one and the same. For him, questions of finance were never merely technical – they were questions of justice.

## The Royal Translator: Language, Learning, and Power  
By the 1370s, Oresme had become not just a scholar writing for other scholars, but **an intellectual architect of French culture**. At the behest of King Charles V, he undertook a grand project: translating Aristotle’s greatest works into **Middle French**, complete with extensive commentaries (or *gloses*) of his own. Between about 1370 and 1377, Oresme produced *Le Livre de Ethiques* (Nicomachean Ethics), *Le Livre de Politiques* (Politics, with the pseudo-Aristotelian Economics), and *Le Livre du ciel et du monde* (On the Heavens) ([part i— the historical context of oresme's translations](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft4m3nb2n4&chunk.id=d0e218&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e218&brand=ucpress#:~:text=translations%20publishing,first%20dates%20from%201370)) – the first complete translations of these works into a living European vernacular. This was an extraordinary intellectual enterprise. It amounted to **translating philosophy itself** from the cloistered Latin of the universities into the language of the French court and literate laypeople. Oresme approached the task with a blend of humility and bold innovation. In his prefaces, he invokes the tradition of *translatio studii* – the idea that knowledge, like empire, passes westward. Just as Aristotle’s Greek had been translated into Arabic and Latin in previous eras, now Latinate wisdom would be translated into French, *“la plus belle et la plus noble”* of contemporary tongues (as court propagandists liked to say). Oresme justified the effort explicitly: *“he justified his translation from Latin, the savant language of his time, to the more vulgar Middle French as part of the translatio studii.”* Knowledge should not remain the monopoly of Latin clerics, especially when a wise king like Charles could benefit from Aristotle’s counsel in his own language.

Translating Aristotle was no straightforward task. Medieval French lacked much of the abstract vocabulary of scholastic Latin. But Oresme proved immensely creative – he effectively **forged a new philosophical lexicon in French**. He coined numerous French neologisms, often by taking Greek or Latin terms and giving them French form. Words like *politique* (politics/policy), *communité* (community), *monarchie*, *tyrannie*, *democracie*, *vicieuse* (vicious, in the sense of morally corrupt) – many of these either appear first in Oresme or gain currency through his works. In one revealing gloss, Oresme introduces the term *policie*: *“Policie est l’ordenance du gouvernement de toute la communité ou multitude civile. Et policie est l’ordre des princeps ou offices publiques. Et est dit de polis en grec, qu’est multitude ou cité.”* – “Policy (polity) is the ordering of the government of the whole community or civil multitude. And policy is the order of public principal offices. It comes from *polis* in Greek, which means multitude or city.” Here we see Oresme acting as **professor in French**, teaching the reader a concept by defining it, even tracing the etymology from Greek. Such passages amount to more than translation; they are **acts of philosophy** – clarifying concepts, sometimes expanding on Aristotle, sometimes subtly adapting him to a Christian French context.

The relationship between Oresme’s Latin scholarly commentary and his French glosses is complex and fascinating. In Latin, writing for fellow theologians at the university, Oresme could engage in technical debates (for example, in his *Physics* commentary he discusses the definition of time or place with references to other scholastics). In French, writing for the king, he adopts a more narrative and explanatory tone, often illustrating principles with examples from history or everyday life. Yet the French works are not “dumbed down.” They are richly *theoretical*, but tuned to the concerns of governance and moral leadership. In the *Livre de Politiques*, Oresme’s glosses sometimes exceed Aristotle’s text in length, effectively becoming a **political philosophy treatise of his own** embedded in the translation. For instance, Aristotle’s Politics advocates a mixed aristocracy, but Oresme, influenced by Christian kingship, openly favors monarchy – provided it is tempered by justice. *“Like Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Auvergne (and quite unlike Aristotle), Oresme favours monarchy as the best form of government,”* one modern summary notes. In his glosses, Oresme lays out his vision: the criterion for good government is the **common good** (*bien commun*). A true king (by definition, he argues, a “king” is good) always seeks the common good, whereas a tyrant seeks private benefit. To keep monarchy from sliding into tyranny, Oresme insists on the importance of **law** and counsel. *“Oresme doesn’t comply with the conception of the French king as sacred… Although he heavily criticizes the Church as corrupt… he never questions its necessity,”* an analysis of his Politics notes. In Oresme’s view, the king is *not above the law*; indeed, *“Oresme prescribes the law as superior to the king’s will”*, and kings should change laws only with extreme caution for necessity. Furthermore, while rejecting any right of violent rebellion (he lived through rebellions and saw their horror), he does endorse a form of **popular participation**: the community of *reasonable and virtuous* men should have a role in governance. They might elect the prince (in circumstances where a new dynasty is needed) or offer consent and advice, and even *“correct”* the prince’s policies for the sake of the common good. This is a remarkably proto-constitutional outlook – a king limited by law and guided by the wisdom of his people (though Oresme’s “people” pointedly excludes the ignorant; it means essentially the educated bourgeois and nobility). 

By translating and glossing Aristotle’s Ethics and Politics, Oresme in effect **naturalized Aristotelian moral philosophy into French soil**. He often finds parallels between Aristotle’s ideas and Christian doctrine. For example, when Aristotle discusses virtue as a habit of moderation, Oresme might invoke the concept of the *mean* as analogous to the Christian virtue of temperance. When Aristotle critiques tyranny, Oresme can’t resist augmenting it with his own era’s examples – the bad king John II, or the dangers of France under a weak regency. His French texts are thus a weave of ancient philosophy and contemporary commentary. It’s as if Aristotle were speaking old truths directly to 14th-century France, with Oresme as the intermediary and interpreter. Charles V valued these works enormously; manuscripts of Oresme’s translations were illuminated lavishly and placed in the royal library. Through these volumes, Oresme influenced the **political culture of France**: later thinkers like Christine de Pizan would draw on his terminology and ideas, and the very language of French governance absorbed Oresme’s coinages (*chose publique* for res publica, *bien commun*, *lois* politiques, etc.). 

Nicole Oresme understood that **language is power**. By giving the French language a philosophical voice, he was empowering his nation to think in new ways. In his translator’s prologue, he acknowledges the limitations of French, but also its potential. He compares Latin and French much as one might compare an older tree and a young sapling: the young tree can grow if carefully tended. Oresme even addresses the worry that translating Aristotle might introduce errors or dilute the rigor. He concedes that no translation can be perfect, but he argues it is worth doing – for the *utility* of those who cannot read Latin. His translations are thus also **acts of pedagogy and statecraft**: they educate the king and his officers in ethics and politics, aiming to create a more enlightened rulership. In a sense, Oresme’s translations are the capstone of his career: after analyzing motion, time, and the cosmos; after refuting astrology and setting out just monetary policy; he turns to the moral and political order, hoping to shape a **wise prince**. He had risen by then to be Charles V’s close advisor (and in 1377 would be made Bishop of Lisieux). The themes he chose to translate – ethics, politics, cosmology – mirror the broad scope of his own mind. And by translating them, he signals that these are **universal truths** not confined to the university, but available to laymen and laywomen (we know Christine de Pizan read Oresme’s French Aristotle) in their own tongue.

## Oresme’s World: Unity in Diversity  
Reading Nicole Oresme’s complete works is like touring a medieval cathedral of ideas: diverse intricate carvings unified by an underlying design. Whether he is charting a new geometry of qualities, pondering the rotation of the Earth, attacking the folly of horoscopes, or advising a king on fiscal morality, Oresme is guided by a faith in **rational order**. He believes in a cosmos created by God but intelligible to man – a world where mathematics, physics, ethics, and politics each have their logic, yet all cohere in the larger truth. Importantly, Oresme always seeks the **mean between extremes**. As a natural philosopher, he walks the line between radical innovation and respect for tradition: he’ll countenance a moving Earth, but ultimately defer to Aristotle’s single cosmos (albeit mostly for scriptural, not scientific, reasons) ([
Nicole Oresme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=stars,Aristotelian%20tenet%20of%20a%20single)). As a clergyman-economist, he upholds the monarchy, but urges it toward reform, warning of tyranny while rejecting anarchy. As a translator, he does not overthrow Latin scholasticism but builds upon it, extending its reach to vernacular culture.

Certain *recurring themes* thread through all his works. One is the idea of **measurement and harmony**. In the realm of physics and math, this appears as his quest to measure intensities and motions – giving each quality its geometric “shape” so that nothing escapes rational representation. In the moral realm, it surfaces as the idea of measuring our actions by the rule of reason and virtue (the “mean” of Ethics). In economics, it’s the insistence that money’s value be stable and true, a just measure for exchange. Even in music – a subject Oresme touched upon in other minor treatises – he looked for numerical ratios underlying harmony. For Oresme, **God had ordered the world in weight, measure, and number**, and human wisdom consisted in discerning that order.

Another theme is **skepticism of unfounded authority**. Oresme does not accept a claim just because a famed source (be it Aristotle or an astrologer or a king) asserts it. He tests ideas: Would a moving Earth actually contradict our experience? Aristotle said yes, but Oresme, in effect, runs a mental experiment and answers no. Kings claimed absolute rights over coin; Oresme asks by what logic or justice, and finds those claims wanting. Astrologers peddled predictions; Oresme demands their evidence, finds internal incoherence and boldly dubs their art *“totally false”*. In all this, Oresme was guided by **natural reason and practical experience** (*experimentum*). He was, in modern terms, an empiricist and a rationalist in equal measure – insisting that theories align with observed reality and logical principles. This approach placed him at odds with more credulous or tradition-bound contemporaries, but it is precisely what makes his writings feel surprisingly fresh and “modern” in tone. Oresme trusts the **God-given faculties** of human reason and senses. Indeed, in an age when many philosophers still leaned on authority and superstition, Oresme can sound like a Renaissance man ahead of his time.

Yet Oresme never strays far from his medieval framework. He remains a man of the 14th century, profoundly Christian in outlook. His skepticism is not cynicism; it is aimed at clearing away error so that faith and reason can shine together. In his commentaries on Aristotle, he occasionally invokes Scripture or Church Fathers to support a point. In his discussion of the nature of **time and eternity**, for instance, Oresme echoes Boethius: the creator’s eternity is an all-at-once presence (*tota simul*), distinct from the successive flowing time of creation. Thus he affirms the medieval distinction between God’s unchanging eternity and the mutable time of the physical world – a point of theology reinforcing the idea that only God has true foreknowledge (hence astrology is folly). Likewise, when urging the king to govern for the common good, Oresme often couches it in terms of Christian virtue and the king’s soul. He never advocates secularism; rather, he calls for *both* Church and State to reform themselves – the Church to eschew corruption and tyranny within its own hierarchy, and the State to uphold justice and not encroach on spiritual matters. In this, one hears echoes of his teacher and friend, the radical thinker **Marsilius of Padua**, whom Oresme cautiously quotes in the *Politiques*. Oresme was even accused (unjustly) of translating Marsilius’ *Defensor pacis*, a scandalous book in its time. Though he defended himself and remained a loyal son of the Church, Oresme clearly shared Marsilius’ vision of a well-ordered commonwealth where church and state each have limited, rational roles.

Nicole Oresme died in 1382, just as the medieval world was itself undergoing convulsions (the Western Schism in the Church had begun, and France would soon face new crises). He did not live to see the Renaissance or the scientific revolutions that would vindicate some of his boldest ideas (like Earth’s motion) and carry forward his mathematical innovations (his work on fractional exponents and infinite series would be rediscovered and applauded by later generations). But in his own lifetime, Oresme achieved a synthesis of knowledge that was rare. A modern historian calls him *“one of the principal forerunners of modern science”* ([Oresme, Nicole | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-9917-7_1040#:~:text=French%20bishop%2C%20scholastic%20philosopher%2C%20economist%2C,published%20well%20into%20the%20Renaissance)), and indeed his insights foreshadow Copernicus, Descartes, and Newton. Yet to place him only as a harbinger of the future is to miss the fullness of his *medieval genius*. Oresme’s ideas emerge from the questions and needs of his time: how to reconcile Aristotle with Christian doctrine, how to guide a Christian king, how to educate a society in truth and discourage error. He answered these with a distinctive combination of **scholastic rigor and vernacular clarity**, of philosophical depth and practical savvy. 

In a way, Oresme fulfilled the ideal of the philosopher that he himself sketched in his writings: a lover of truth who uses reason, open to experience, serving the common good. He was the consummate **thematic thinker** of his age – moving fluidly from the geometry of a continuum to the balance of a just polity, from the music of the spheres to the harmony of the king’s coin and realm. Each theme – motion, time, cosmology, language, money, governance – was like a chapter in the greater book of wisdom he sought to write with his life’s work. And indeed, he wrote literally in books, in an era when writing was manual labor. One can imagine him hunched over a desk in the Navarre College in Paris, crafting a Latin treatise on ratios by candlelight; then years later, at court in a robe of office, dictating polished French prose about royal duties. In both scenes, the same incisive mind is at work. 

Near the end of *Le Livre du ciel et du monde*, Oresme reflects on the beauty of the cosmos Aristotle described, and subtly, on the limits of Aristotle’s understanding. He muses that God could have made many worlds, even if Aristotle thought not ([

](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nicole-oresme/#:~:text=stars,Aristotelian%20tenet%20of%20a%20single)). He concedes we humans cannot be certain, but that possibility enlarges his perspective: the God of Oresme is not bound by the tidy cosmos of the ancients. This humility before the mystery of creation, coupled with confidence in human reason’s ability to explore that creation, defines Nicole Oresme’s intellectual character. **Immersed in his medieval world, he still speaks to ours**. The questions he grappled with – the ethical role of money, the abuse of pseudoscience, the translation of knowledge into accessible language, the reconciliation of faith with empirical inquiry – are perennially relevant. By listening to Oresme’s own voice, across centuries, we encounter a mind at once rigorously logical and deeply humane, a scholar who truly made his life’s work *“une policie de la communité”* – an ordering of knowledge for the good of the community. Nicole Oresme’s world was the 14th century, but his ideas form a legacy that transcends it, a lasting testament to the power of reason guided by virtue.
