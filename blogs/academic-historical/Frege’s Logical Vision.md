# In the Realm of Pure Thought: Frege’s Logical Vision

## The Architecture of Logic

In the late 19th century, Gottlob Frege set out to design nothing less than a new language for pure thought. As a mathematician troubled by the **“imprecision and ambiguity of ordinary language”**, Frege devised his *Begriffsschrift* or *“concept-script,”* a formal symbolism meant to lay bare the skeleton of logical inference ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=In%20studying%20the%20concept%20of,devised%20a%20new%20mode%20of)) ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=6%20FREGE%20obstacle%3B%20no%20matter,reliable%20test%20of%20the%20validity)). Its purpose was not ornamental. Frege wanted a lingua franca of logic that could **“provide us with the most reliable test of the validity of a chain of inferences and point out every presupposition that tries to sneak in unnoticed”**, stripping away anything not essential to reasoning ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=that%20my%20purpose%20required,In%20%C2%A73%20I)). This austere language would focus on what Frege called the **“conceptual content”** of statements — that which influences their inferential power — and **“forgo expressing anything that is without significance for the inferential sequence.”** ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=sneak%20in%20unnoticed%2C%20so%20that,for%20the%20time%20being%20to)) In effect, Frege was inventing a microscope for thought, a tool to reveal logical structure with greater precision than the naked eye of natural language could afford.

Frege himself drew this comparison in the *Begriffsschrift* preface. Ordinary language, for all its richness, is like the human eye: versatile and vital in daily life, yet too coarse for delicate scientific work. His logical notation, by contrast, was a specialized instrument: **“I believe that I can best make the relation of my ideography to ordinary language clear if I compare it to that which the microscope has to the eye,”** Frege writes ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=I%20believe%20that%20I%20can,sure%2C%20it%20exhibits%20many%20imperfections)). The eye ranges widely and adapts to myriad purposes, but **“as soon as scientific goals demand great sharpness of resolution, the eye proves to be insufficient. The microscope, on the other hand, is perfectly suited to precisely such goals… but that is just why it is useless for all others.”** ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=ordinarily%20remain%20unnoticed%20only%20on,for%20certain%20scientific%20purposes%2C%20and)) So too with his logic: a device invented for certain scientific purposes, not meant to replace everyday speech, but to augment it where precision is needed. Frege knew his symbolic calculus would not be easy to read at first glance – *“an initial impression of strangeness”* was inevitable ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=exercise,the%20fact%20that%20logic%20has)) – yet he believed these innovations were necessary to advance logic itself. Indeed, he boldly claims that **“the mere invention of this ideography has, it seems to me, advanced logic”**, urging logicians not to be frightened by its novelty ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=exercise,the%20fact%20that%20logic%20has)). Just as Bacon lauded new methods that extend our investigative powers ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=my%20work,)), Frege saw his concept-script as a methodological breakthrough rather than a collection of new truths: an improvement of the tool of thought.

Central to Frege’s logical architecture is a rethinking of the very **building blocks of judgment**. Traditional grammar speaks of subject and predicate; Frege replaces them with **argument and function**. In his view, the predicate of a sentence can be understood as a *function* — an unsaturated expression needing an input — and the subject term as the *argument* that saturates it. This was a radical shift, and Frege anticipated resistance. But he was confident: **“I believe that the replacement of the concepts *subject* and *predicate* by *argument* and *function*, respectively, will stand the test of time,”** he writes, noting that when we regard a content as a function of an argument, the logical interconnections (the meanings of *if*, *and*, *not*, *there is*, *all*, etc.) come to the fore with new clarity ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=followed%20ordinary%20language%20and%20grammar,or%2C%20there%20is%2C%20some%2C%20all)). These deviations from tradition, Frege argues, are justified because logic had **“hitherto always followed ordinary language and grammar too closely”** ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=necessity%20inherent%20in%20the%20subject,a%20content%20as%20a%20function)). The concept-script breaks with some age-old linguistic habits in order to reveal a purer logical form. For example, Frege’s notation for a judgment divides it into a horizontal content line (the thought) and a vertical assertion sign, separating the act of *asserting* from the content asserted ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=xtutement%20contains%20,we%20split%20up%20the%20sentence)). This allowed him to formalize inference in a rigorous way, distinguishing mere content from endorsed truth. *“Only when this place is filled up with a proper name… does a complete sense appear,”* Frege explains of his function-argument analysis; *“I give the name ‘function’ to the Bedeutung (reference) of this unsaturated part. In this case the argument is Caesar.”* ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=Thus%2C%20e,case%20the%20argument%20is%20Caesar)) By parsing sentences like “Caesar conquered Gaul” into a function (“– conquered Gaul”) and an argument (“Caesar”), Frege showed how the logical structure of predication could be made explicit, each predicate containing a placeholder to be filled. Logic, in Frege’s system, thus treats a proposition as a function mapping an object to a truth value, and **“the parts of the sentence split into a saturated and an unsaturated part.”** ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=into%20a%20saturated%20and%20an,split%20up%20the%20%27unsaturated%27%20part)) ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=Thus%2C%20e,case%20the%20argument%20is%20Caesar))

Frege’s logical edifice was built with a clear goal: to ground arithmetic in pure logic. *“The most reliable way of carrying out a proof,”* Frege observes, *“is to follow **pure logic**, a way that… depends solely on those laws upon which all knowledge rests.”* ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=The%20most%20reliable%20way%20of,supported%20by%20facts%20of%20experience)) If all of arithmetic could be derived using logic alone, it would show that mathematical truths are fundamentally logical truths. Frege’s *Begriffsschrift* (1879) laid the formal groundwork by introducing a calculus of logic powerful enough to express mathematical propositions. In the *Grundgesetze der Arithmetik* (1893–1903), he pushed this program further, attempting to derive the basic laws of numbers within that system. In doing so, Frege divided truths into two kinds: those provable by logic alone and those that require empirical support ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=laws%20upon%20which%20all%20knowledge,human%20mind%20without%20any%20activity)). He asked which kind arithmetic belongs to, and set out to show it belongs to the former. *“I first had to ascertain how far one could proceed in arithmetic by means of inferences alone, with the sole support of those laws of thought that transcend all particulars,”* Frege writes, recounting the genesis of his project ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=is%20at%20the%20basis%20of,To%20prevent)). In fact, it was in struggling to define the concept of numerical sequence logically that Frege felt ordinary language begin to buckle, prompting his invention of the concept-script: **“I found the inadequacy of language to be an obstacle… This deficiency led me to the idea of the present ideography.”** ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=anything%20intuitive%20,development%20is%20possible%20in%20the)) ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=6%20FREGE%20obstacle%3B%20no%20matter,reliable%20test%20of%20the%20validity)) The outcome was not just a new notation, but a new understanding of logic itself – not as a mere shadow of natural language or psychology, but as an autonomous domain with its own architecture.

For Frege, **logic provides the laws of truth**. In a 1918 article aptly titled “Der Gedanke” (“The Thought”), he reflects succinctly on the calling of this discipline: **“To discover truths is the task of all sciences; it falls to logic to discern the laws of truth.”** ([reference request - Frege on truth? - History of Science and Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/18138/frege-on-truth#:~:text=,discern%20the%20laws%20of%20truth)) Just as the physicist seeks laws of nature, the logician seeks the laws that govern true and false, independent of any particular subject matter. Frege sharply distinguished these **laws of truth** from the contingent truths of experience. *“I assign to logic the task of discovering the laws of truth, not of assertion or thought,”* he wrote, rejecting any conflation of logic with how we happen to think ([reference request - Frege on truth? - History of Science and Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/18138/frege-on-truth#:~:text=,discern%20the%20laws%20of%20truth)) ([frege2](https://philarchive.org/archive/DEAFCO#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20logic%20is,other%20attempt%20to%20define%20truth)). The laws of logic, in Frege’s conception, are about objective truth — *“not what I or anyone may think is true, but what **is** true”* — and thus they are not psychological laws of thinking but normative laws of correct inference. In Frege’s logical realm, **thought becomes an object of study in its own right**, abstracted from the thinker. This architectonic vision would underpin all of Frege’s later inquiries: from the nature of number to the puzzle of meaning, everything had to be reconstructed in accordance with the stringent blueprint of logic.

## The Nature of Number

What, then, is a number? This question, seemingly so simple, had no clear answer in the mathematics of Frege’s day. Is a number a property of physical collections? An idea in our mind? A metaphysical entity? Frege approached the riddle of number with the same desire for logical clarity that drove his concept-script. **“Number is not anything physical, but nor is it anything subjective, an idea,”** he asserts plainly ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=asserted%20in%20making%20a%20statement,Even)). It is something abstract and objective. In his 1884 monograph *Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik* (*The Foundations of Arithmetic*), Frege undertakes a deep investigation into the concept of number, insisting on grounding it in logic rather than psychology or intuition. Right at the outset, he lays down fundamental principles to guide this inquiry: *“There must be a sharp separation of the **psychological** from the **logical**, the **subjective** from the **objective**; [and] the meaning of a word must be asked for in the context of a proposition, not in isolation; [also] the distinction between **concept** and **object** must be kept in mind.”* ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=X%20In%20this%20investigation%20I,and%20have%20distinguished%20ideas%20from)) These maxims declare war on subjective theories of meaning and number. Frege will not allow number to be explained as a mere aggregate of mental images or a property of physical piles. Number, for Frege, has to be understood through the **content of propositions** and in terms of concepts and objects in logic.

One of Frege’s key insights is often summarized as the **context principle**: *“Never ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition.”* Only in a complete proposition (such as an equation or a statement like “There are 4 apples”) does a word like “4” truly acquire a definite meaning ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=There%20must%20be%20a%20sharp,principle%20is%20not%20observed%2C%20then)). This principle was meant to ward off the temptation to think of numbers as mental images (what comes to mind when we hear “4”) or as isolated entities without regard to how they function in true statements. If we violate this, Frege says, *“one is almost forced to take as the meaning of words mental images or acts of an individual mind, and thereby to offend against the first [principle] as well.”* ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=always%20in%20the%20psychological%20sense%2C,be%20only%20indic%02ated%20in%20the)) In other words, treating “four” as if it had meaning on its own invites subjective interpretations (like four as an image of four dots, etc.), whereas its true meaning lies in the role it plays in propositions (like “4 is the number of seasons in a year”). Frege’s context principle thus ties the meaning of numerical terms to their **use in assertions**, paving the way to see numbers not as tangible things nor as private ideas, but as logical objects defined by their relations.

Frege famously concluded that a **statement of number is a statement about a concept**. When we say “There are 4 horses,” we are not really talking about any particular horse or collection of horses, nor about the numeral “4” itself as an object—we are saying something about the *concept* *horse*. Specifically, we are saying that the concept *horse* has 4 instances. Frege puts it in these terms: **“When we do make a statement of number (i.e. say ‘There are *n* Fs’), we can indeed be seen as asserting something about a concept.”** ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=lost,how%20to%20generalize)) The concept in question (e.g. *horse*) is the true subject of the proposition, and the number word (e.g. “4”) is predicated of that concept. This idea is subtle but crucial. It means, for instance, that the sentence “There are 4 horses” is not about any individual horse at all – it doesn’t single out which horses – but rather about the concept of being a horse, saying it has the property “4-ness” in this instance. Frege underscores that **“having recognized that a statement of number contains an assertion about a concept, we can attempt to complete the definitions of the individual numbers by defining 0 and 1”** ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=%C2%A75%205,a%20concept%20if%20no%20object)). In other words, once number statements are understood as concept-related, Frege proceeds to *define* numbers in purely logical terms as properties of concepts.

His strategy is elegant. First, he defines what it means for two concepts to have the same number (to be *equinumerous*) – essentially by saying there is a one-to-one correspondence between the objects falling under them. From this, he seeks to define each particular number. Frege’s definition of **zero** is especially striking: **“The number 0 is the Number which belongs to the concept *not identical with itself*.”** ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=of%20the%20number%200%2C%20Frege,Now)) This peculiar concept (*not identical with itself*) is a concept under which nothing can fall – no object is unequal to itself – so it is a concept with zero instances. Thus, by definition, the number that belongs to that concept is 0. Frege notes that there is no problem using such a concept with a contradiction, since **“of every object it is known that it does not fall under such a concept”** ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=In%20offering%20this%2C%20Frege%20remarks,that%20it%20can%20be%20specified)). The key point is that 0 is characterized without invoking any intuition of “emptiness” or metaphors of collection; it emerges logically as the number assigned to a concept that nothing falls under. Likewise, **“the number 1”** can be defined as **“the Number which belongs to the concept ‘identical with 0’,”** since exactly one object (namely 0 itself) falls under that concept ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=Frege%20goes%20on%20to%20show,0%27%20but%20not%20identical%20with)). By proceeding in this way, Frege builds the natural numbers step by step: each number *n* is the number belonging to the concept “being an element of the series ending in *n*,” thus generating *n+1* as the next number ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=,the%20materials%20for%20doing%20so)). In Frege’s own formulation: **“the number *n+1* is the Number which belongs to the concept *member of the natural number series ending with n*.”** ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=,the%20materials%20for%20doing%20so)) This recursive definition, once unpacked, mirrors the Peano successor principle, but grounded in logical concepts rather than a special axiom of succession.

Frege’s greatest pride was that he had defined *number* itself. After introducing the definitions of 0 and the successor function, he defines what it means to be a number in general. A *Number* in Frege’s system is essentially an **equivalence class of concepts under equinumerosity**, or as he put it: *“the Number which belongs to the concept F”* is defined as *“the extension of the concept ‘equinumerous to F’.”* ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=belongs%20to%20it%27%3B%20and%20this,not%20identical%20with%20itself%2C%20yield%02ing)) ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=%27%20,unproblemati%02cally%20a%20logical%20notion%2C%203)) In plainer terms, the number of a concept *F* is the collection of all concepts that have the same number of instances as *F*. Thus numbers become certain higher-level logical objects (extensions of concepts) in his ontology. This was the culmination of Frege’s logicist ambition in *Grundlagen*: showing that we can talk about numbers without ever leaving the realm of concepts, extensions, and logic. The payoff is that arithmetic truths (like *5+3=8*) could then be derived logically from these definitions (though the full execution of that derivation was left to his later work, *Grundgesetze*).

Frege was meticulous about avoiding what he called the **“Julius Caesar problem”** – the worry that a purely formal definition of number might not rule out strange cases, like someone interpreting “the number 1” as Julius Caesar. His definitions are crafted so that it will be a *logical* matter of fact that a statement like “Caesar is a number” is false or meaningless. Numbers, being defined as extensions of concepts, occupy their own category of object. Frege guarded this boundary by insisting on the concept–object distinction (of which more later). In *Grundlagen* §68, he argues that any acceptable definition of number must provide a criterion of identity for numbers that clearly prevents, say, the number 2 from ever being confused with an ordinary object like a person ([Could anyone offer a good explanation for what Frege's Julius ...](https://www.quora.com/Could-anyone-offer-a-good-explanation-for-what-Freges-Julius-Caesar-problem-is#:~:text=A%20definition%20of%20numbers%20that,a%20definition%20of%20number)). If someone proposed that numbers are just certain collections of things, we could ask pointedly: is the number 0 the same thing as *Julius Caesar* (since Caesar might be seen as a collection of zero things of some kind)? A good theory of number should make such a question as absurd as it intuitively is. Frege’s theory achieves this by making numbers specific kinds of abstract objects (extensions of concepts) for which the only way they can equal something else is if that something else is the extension of some concept equinumerous to a given one. There is no concept equinumerous to *not identical with itself* that would yield “Julius Caesar” as an extension, so “0 = Julius Caesar” comes out false by the logic of the system, not by an ad hoc rule.

By the time of *Grundgesetze der Arithmetik*, Frege believed he had a rock-solid logical foundation for arithmetic. He introduces in that work Basic Law V, which governs these extensions of concepts (roughly, it says two concepts have the same extension if and only if they are true of exactly the same objects). For a while, it seemed Frege had succeeded in deriving the truths of arithmetic logically. However, an unforeseen crisis emerged: Bertrand Russell famously discovered a contradiction in Frege’s law of extensions in 1902, just as Volume II of *Grundgesetze* was about to go to press. The system proved inconsistent – Frege’s logical foundation had a crack. In an appendix added with a heavy heart, Frege acknowledged the paradox that now bore Russell’s name and confessed, *“A scientist can hardly encounter anything more undesirable than to have the foundations give way just as the work is finished.”* He had to abandon Basic Law V as it stood. This blow did not negate Frege’s insights about numbers outright, but it showed that some adjustment was needed (in fact, much later work in logic and philosophy of math, by Russell, Zermelo, and others, would grapple with exactly how to save Frege’s project from paradox). In the spirit of our task, which is to dwell in Frege’s own vision, we note that Frege never gave up the conviction that numbers are logical objects – he briefly considered modifying his system, and in his later years even explored whether arithmetic could stand on geometry instead, but the core view remained: arithmetic is analytic, derived from laws of logic plus definitions. *“Numbers are self-subsistent objects,”* he insisted, not fleeting ideas ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=asserted%20in%20making%20a%20statement,Even)). If his specific system faltered on a technical point, the *idea* of logicism – that **the truths of arithmetic are truths of logic** – carried on. Indeed, Frege’s legacy in this regard was profound: by treating numbers as logical objects and arithmetic as an extension of logic, he set the stage for virtually all later discussions of the foundations of mathematics in analytic philosophy.

In sum, Frege gave a new answer to the ancient question “What is number?”: A number is neither an extramental heap nor a subjective intuition, but an **abstract logical object** that specifies how many objects fall under a given concept. We grasp the number 4, for instance, by grasping the thought that a certain concept (say, *planet orbiting the Sun visible to the naked eye in the morning*) is equinumerous with another concept (say, *planet orbiting the Sun visible in the evening*). It turned out both concepts picked out 1 object (Venus), but that insight – that one can determine number through one-to-one correspondence – is made formal in Frege’s definitions. Arithmetic thus becomes, in Frege’s phrase, a branch of logic, and its fundamental statements (like definitions of successor, addition, etc.) become provable propositions in the concept-script. No appeal to human intuition of plurality or the passage of time or any sort of mental construct is required. Frege’s *Foundations* does philosophy with a mathematician’s clarity: he examines other theories (like those of Leibniz, Mill, or Kant) and finds them wanting, then steadily constructs his own. By the final pages, he admits his definitions may seem *“unnatural”* to some, but **“the question here is not whether they are natural, but whether they go to the heart of the matter and are logically unobjectionable.”** ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=not%20really%20as%20a%20mode,)) He was convinced that, in essence, they do. Even if Frege’s precise system didn’t survive intact, the clarity of his answer forever changed how philosophers think about numbers: not as mysterious Platonic entities apprehended by intuition alone, nor as mere marks on paper, but as logical objects we can define and reason about through the very structure of propositions.

## Thought and Language

Frege’s investigation into logic and arithmetic inevitably led him to reflect on the nature of **thought** itself – and its intimate relation to **language**. If logic provides the laws of truth, what kind of thing is it that can be true or false? Frege’s answer: it is **thoughts** (Gedanken) that are true or false. But by “thought” he did not mean a private mental process. He meant the *content* of a statement, the proposition expressed. In Frege’s terminology, a **Thought** is the *sense* of a sentence (about which we will say more shortly). Frege put forward a terse and influential characterization: **“Without wishing to give a definition, I call a thought something for which the question of truth arises. So I ascribe what is false to a thought just as much as what is true… the thought is the sense of the sentence.”** ([frege2](https://philarchive.org/archive/DEAFCO#:~:text=2%20Frege%20gives%20a%20tentative,The%20Thought%2C%20in%20itself)) A thought, in this technical sense, is not a psychological event in a person’s mind; it is an abstract, shareable content that can be communicated by language and that can bear a truth-value. Whenever we have a complete declarative sentence, if it expresses something that could be true or false, it expresses a Thought. 

This view marks a clean break from thinking of thoughts as subjective happenings (ideas, impressions, etc.). Frege famously argued that **thoughts exist in a “third realm”**, neither physical nor mental. In a striking passage, he writes: **“So the result seems to be: thoughts are neither things of the outer world nor ideas. A third realm must be recognized.”** ([Why Thoughts Are Not In The Head: Frege on Sense | by John C. Brady | Epoché (ἐποχή) | Medium](https://medium.com/epoch%C3%A9-%E1%BC%90%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%87%CE%AE/why-thoughts-are-not-in-the-head-frege-on-sense-b0fd2711340#:~:text=Share)) They are not located in space or accessible to the senses (unlike physical objects), but neither are they dependent on any single mind (unlike personal ideas or images). If two people grasp the same thought, Frege insists, they literally have the *same* thought in mind, not two numerically distinct copies. This is possible only because the thought exists in this third realm of objective content, which Frege sometimes calls the realm of sense. A thought does not **“belong to the inner world of the individual mind, nor to the outer world of material perceptible things”**; rather, it is something that **“can be grasped by several thinkers”** and is **“not made true by a thinker’s believing it nor made false by anyone’s doubting it.”** These convictions were spelled out in “The Thought” (1918), where Frege stresses that truth is independent of our perception: *“The thought, in itself immaterial, does not require an owner… Its being true has nothing to do with being recognized as true by anyone.”* In Frege’s eyes, this objectivity of thoughts is what makes communication possible. If each of us had only private ideas, we could never really understand one another or speak of a common world. **“If thoughts were merely ideas,”** Frege argues, **“then all my thoughts would be only mine and yours only yours, and communication would be impossible.”** ([frege2](https://philarchive.org/archive/DEAFCO#:~:text=In%20classical%20theory%2C%20ideas%20had,For%20Frege)) But in fact, we do communicate – we grasp the same thoughts through language – which shows that thoughts must have an existence not tied to any single person.

Language is the bridge that connects individual minds to the realm of thoughts. A sentence, by expressing a thought, allows that thought to *enter two different minds at once*. Frege emphasizes that the **sense** of a sentence – the thought it expresses – is where the question of truth resides. *“A sentence expresses a sense but does not itself assert; only a **judgeable content** (a thought) can be said to be true or false,”* he clarifies. This is why in logic Frege distinguished the *content* of a proposition from the act of *asserting* it (using his special assertion sign `⊢` in *Begriffsschrift* to indicate affirmation). The thought can be considered on its own, without yet deciding if it’s true. In communication, when someone utters a declarative sentence seriously, they typically assert a thought and present it as true. The listener can grasp that thought and then consider its truth. Frege gives a simple example: the sentence “5 is a prime number” expresses a thought; that thought is true. We could also express the same thought by a different sentence (in another language, or a paraphrase in English), and it would have the same truth-value. The sentence is just the vehicle; the thought is the proposition it carries, and the truth-value is what awaits at the end of the journey if the proposition is evaluated.

One of Frege’s renowned contributions is the idea that **the meaning of a sentence (its *sense*) is a thought**. This ties back to the context principle: words have meaning only through their contribution to the thought expressed by the whole sentence. In *Grundlagen*, Frege was already adamant that we must **“always keep in mind the distinction between concept and object”** and not confuse a word’s reference with a subjective idea ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=There%20must%20be%20a%20sharp,offend%20against%20the%20first%20as)). By the time of his semantic writings (1890s), he refined this into a full theory of sense (Sinn) and reference (Bedeutung). But an important precursor is his stance against psychologism: *“If the second principle [context principle] is not observed,”* he warns, *“then one is almost forced to take as the meaning of words mental images or acts of an individual mind, and thereby to offend against the first [principle separating subjective from objective].”* ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=always%20in%20the%20psychological%20sense%2C,be%20only%20indic%02ated%20in%20the)) Frege avoided describing thoughts as images in the head. He preferred to speak of understanding a thought as *grasping* a content that is objectively there. The mind, in thinking, does not create thoughts but rather perceives or apprehends them – somewhat like how the eye perceives a distant star. This almost Platonic picture of thoughts might seem peculiar, but Frege found it necessary to explain how mathematics and logic achieve objectivity. The theorem of Pythagoras, for example, is a thought that is true eternally and not “owned” by anyone; it was true before Pythagoras discovered it and remains true even if no one contemplates it for a thousand years. Frege’s theory of thought secures this independence.

To further illustrate the relation between thought and language, Frege distinguishes **sense versus idea (Vorstellung)**. My idea of a tree (the mental image I have) is private and evanescent; the sense of the word “tree” is something rather different – it is the mode of presentation of the *tree* in the realm of language, which can be shared. Frege gives an example: if two people both think of the morning star, each has their own mental idea, but the *sense* “the brightest star in the morning sky” can be common to them, and hence they can talk meaningfully about **the same** thing ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=The%20sense%20of%20a%20proper,Aristotle%27%20opinions%20as%20to%20the)) ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=instance%2C%20be%20taken%20to%20be,to%20occur%20in%20a%20perfect)). In Frege’s words, *“The reference and sense of a sign are to be distinguished from the associated idea. If the reference of a sign is an object perceivable by the senses, my idea of it is an internal image, wholly subjective; in between lies the sense, which is indeed not subjective like the idea, but is yet not the object itself.”* ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=every%20grammatically%20well,since%20for%20every%20given%20convergent)) The sense is something in between the tangible object and the thinker’s mind—a *third realm* entity that is objective (the same for all speakers) but not material. Because of this layered view, Frege can say that **language “expresses” a thought** (via sense) and “designates” or “stands for” an object (via reference), without collapsing the two. Thought is thus tightly linked to language: every fully formed thought can in principle be expressed in a sentence (if not, we might question whether it is a clear thought at all), and every meaningful declarative sentence corresponds to a thought. The thought is what different sentences in different languages can have in common – for instance, *Schnee ist weiss* and *Snow is white* express the same thought, that snow is white.

Frege’s reverence for the integrity of thought led him to an almost ethical view of logic and communication. In his later essays, he emphasizes that one should **“never mix the logical with the psychological”**, and that doing so leads to confusion. Thoughts, being non-empirical, require a sort of intellectual discipline to apprehend. And language, while an imperfect medium, can be refined to correspond more closely to thoughts (just as his concept-script attempted). When we follow Frege into the weeds of logical notation or the fine distinctions of meaning, it is because he believes precision in language can illuminate the very structure of thought. His own writing, even in German, reflects this ideal of clarity: it’s often dry, rigorous, and scrupulous about distinguishing different senses. Yet at times a certain passion shines through, as when he declares in *Grundlagen* that it is “shameful” for a science not to scrutinize its fundamental concepts, or when he extols the pursuit of truth for its own sake. The objective existence of thoughts, for Frege, is almost a guarantor that truth is real and not a human fabrication. One hears an almost moral undertone in Frege’s 1918 remark: *“I understand by ‘laws of truth’ not psychological laws of taking something to be true, but laws of *being* true. … The word ‘true’ denotes an objective quality of **thoughts**.”* Logic, as the study of these laws, becomes the most general science of objective content – a view that has influenced analytic philosophy ever since.

In summary, Frege revolutionized how we think about thought and language by disentangling the subjective from the objective. He gives us a picture in which: 

- **Thoughts** are the immaterial contents of judgment, bearer of truth-values, existing in a realm accessible to all rational beings. 
- **Language** is the vehicle for thoughts; a sentence expresses a thought (its sense) and can thus communicate a thinkable content from one mind to another.
- The **meaning of subsentential parts** (words, phrases) is determined by their contribution to the thought of the whole sentence (context principle).
- **Understanding** a sentence is grasping the thought it expresses; believing or knowing is then relating that thought to truth.

These ideas laid the groundwork for modern philosophy of language and logic. The very notion of a “proposition” as distinct from a sentence and an idea traces back to Frege’s Sinn (sense or thought) as distinct from Zeichen (sign) and Vorstellung (idea). Frege’s insight that truth is a property of thoughts, not of sentences per se (since the same thought can be expressed by different sentences), underlies the entire enterprise of analytic philosophy, where clarifying *thoughts* via language analysis is key. He left us with the enduring image of a vast invisible landscape – the third realm – where thoughts reside, and language as the map that helps our minds navigate that landscape. In Frege’s own scholarly life, mapping that terrain accurately was a calling of the highest order.

## Sense and Reference

No account of Frege’s philosophy would be complete without discussing his most celebrated distinction: that between **Sense (Sinn)** and **Reference (Bedeutung)**. Introduced in his 1892 article *“Über Sinn und Bedeutung”* (“On Sense and Reference”), this distinction elegantly solved puzzles about identity and informativeness that had vexed logicians. Frege asks us to consider a simple equality statement: *a = b*. If it’s true, then a and b name the same object. But how can it be that *a = b* is often a meaningful, non-trivial discovery (like “the morning star = the evening star”), whereas *a = a* is a trivial truth? If identity were just a relation between objects (the referents of the names), then saying “a is b” should convey no more information than “a is a.” After all, if *a* and *b* designate the same object, the content would seemingly be the same. Frege realized the difference lies not in the objects named (which might indeed be identical) but in the **mode of presentation** of that object. The names “morning star” and “evening star” both refer to Venus, but they present Venus in different ways to the mind – different senses.

Frege thus draws a distinction: **a sign (a name, word, or phrase) has both a Sense and a Reference**. The reference (Bedeutung) of a name is the object it stands for in the world; the sense (Sinn) of the name is the way in which that object is given to us, the “mode of presentation” associated with the name ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=It%20is%20natural%2C%20now%2C%20to,The%20reference)). He explains: **“It is natural to think of there being connected with a sign… besides that to which the sign refers, which may be called the *reference* of the sign, also what I should like to call the *sense* of the sign, wherein the mode of presentation is contained. In our example, the reference of the expressions ‘the point of intersection of *a* and *b*’ and ‘the point of intersection of *b* and *c*’ would be the same, but not their senses. The reference of ‘evening star’ would be the same as that of ‘morning star’, but not the sense.”** ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=It%20is%20natural%2C%20now%2C%20to,The%20reference)) This passage encapsulates the idea: *Morning Star* and *Evening Star* both point to Venus (same reference) but differ in sense, explaining why “The morning star is the evening star” is informative, while “The morning star is the morning star” is not.

Every expression that purports to denote something has a sense, according to Frege – a way in which the denotation is presented. Importantly, not every expression has a reference: it might fail to pick out anything in reality. Frege gives examples: **“The words ‘the celestial body most distant from the Earth’ have a sense, but it is very doubtful if they also have a reference. The expression ‘the least rapidly convergent series’ has a sense; but it is known to have no reference.”** ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=every%20grammatically%20well,since%20for%20every%20given%20convergent)) In other words, one can understand the sense of a phrase like “the least rapidly convergent series” (one can grasp what property it describes, roughly), yet there is provably no mathematical object that fits that description – no referent. This shows the importance of separating sense from reference: **sense is about the *intelligible content* of an expression, reference is about its *external designation***. An expression may have sense without reference, but not vice versa (if something lacks sense, it can’t really properly refer either, since we wouldn’t even know what it is referring to).

Frege applied the sense-reference distinction not only to proper names and definite descriptions but also to whole **sentences**. A declarative sentence, viewed as a sign, also has a sense and a reference. Its sense is the *thought* it expresses (as we discussed above). What, then, is its reference? Frege’s surprising and momentous answer: the reference of a sentence is its **truth-value**. More specifically, *every true sentence denotes The True, and every false sentence denotes The False.* This sounds odd at first – how can a sentence “stand for” an abstract truth-value? Frege reasoned that if we want the principle of compositionality (that the reference of a whole expression is determined by the reference of its parts) to extend to sentences, then given that sentences embed in larger sentences (e.g. in “Alice believes that *p*” or “If *p* then *q*”), we must assign them some kind of referential value. The truth-value is the natural candidate, since whether a complex statement is true often depends on the truth of its parts. In Frege’s terms: **“A statement contains (or at least purports to contain) a thought as its sense; and this thought is in general true or false; *i.e.* it has in general a truth-value, which must be regarded as the Bedeutung of the sentence, just as, say, the number 4 is the Bedeutung of the expression ‘2+2’ or London the Bedeutung of the expression ‘the capital of England.’”** ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=xtutement%20contains%20,we%20split%20up%20the%20sentence)) Thus, just as “the capital of England” refers to London, the sentence “London is the capital of England” refers to the truth-value True (since that sentence is true). If we change the sentence to something false, like “London is the capital of France,” its reference would be False.

Why go to this extreme? Frege’s motivation was logical consistency and completeness. By treating truth-values as objects in his domain of discourse, Frege could make quantifiers range over them, allow sentences to appear in certain argument positions, and generally systematize logic. It also nicely explains why an identity statement like “Morning star = Evening star” differs from “Morning star = Morning star.” In Frege’s framework, the sense of a sentence is the thought, and the reference is the truth-value. Now, if you replace one name in a sentence with another name that has the same reference but a different sense, the reference of the sentence (its truth-value) will remain the same, but the sense (the thought expressed) may change. “Morning star = Evening star” and “Morning star = Morning star” both end up referring to True (since indeed Venus = Venus, and that’s true), but as senses, the first expresses a potentially informative thought, the second a trivial one. 

Frege had to introduce a further twist when dealing with *indirect speech* or clauses like “Alice believes that…”. In such contexts, the normal references of words seem to get shifted – e.g. in “Alice believes that the morning star is a planet,” we are not talking about the actual morning star, but about a certain thought Alice entertains. Frege’s solution is that in contexts of indirect discourse, words refer to their customary *senses* rather than their usual referents. He distinguishes **the customary reference** of a word from its **indirect reference** in reported speech ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=It%20is%20clear%20from%20the,everybody%20who%20is%20sufficiently%20familiar)) ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=The%20regular%20connexion%20between%20a,totality%20of%20signs%2C%20there%20should)). The sense of “morning star” (the mode of presentation of Venus) becomes the referent of the phrase “the morning star” in a belief context. This allows him to say that what Alice believes is not the planet Venus itself, but a *thought* (the sense of the embedded sentence). Frege carefully worked out this hierarchy of reference levels to preserve compositionality and make sense of propositional attitude reports.

Coming back to the direct impact of Sense and Reference: this distinction solved the puzzle of informative identities, but it did more. It laid the foundation for semantic analysis in philosophy and linguistics. Frege showed that **meaning is not a single thing**; it has at least two layers. The *sense* is like meaning in the intuitive, cognitive sense – it’s the content of an expression as we understand it. The *reference* is the external correlate, what the expression hooks onto in the world. Sometimes these align neatly (as with a well-defined proper name like “London”), but other times they come apart (as with “Phosphorus” vs “Hesperus” – two names for Venus with different cognitive significance). Frege’s theory predicts phenomena like *meaningful but non-referring terms* (“Pegasus”, “the present King of France”) and *different senses for the same reference*. It also provides a way to talk about *objectivity of meaning*: senses are not idiosyncratic images. Anyone who understands the word “Venus” grasps its sense, even if their mental imagery might differ.

To illustrate Frege’s point in a more poetic way: consider a classic example he gives – the morning star and the evening star. For ages, humans saw a bright star-like object in the east at dawn and another in the west at dusk. They gave them different names and wove different stories. The discovery that these two were one and the same celestial body (Venus) was a genuine astronomical revelation. In Fregean terms, the sense of “morning star” and the sense of “evening star” were distinct – they were *different modes of presentation* – but their reference turned out to be identical. We learned something new about the world (that one object has two guises). Frege’s framework neatly captures why the statement joining those two names is informative: it links two senses to one reference. And once the discovery is made, one could even say the two senses coalesce in a scientist’s understanding of Venus, yet one can remember that they had been distinct routes to the same referent.

Frege extended the sense/reference analysis to all kinds of expressions: not just singular terms (names, descriptions) but also predicates and functional expressions. A predicate like “__ is a planet” has a sense (a concept, which is a function from objects to truth-values) and a reference (its extension, which in this case could be seen as the set of all planets, or better, the *concept* itself as a mapping rule). Here we arrive at a subtle point: when Frege says a predicate has a reference, he does not mean it picks out a concrete object – rather, it denotes a *concept* (which for him is a kind of function). The sense of the predicate is more akin to a concept’s “intension” in later terminology, while the reference is the concept itself (understood extensionaly). However, because Frege identifies concepts with their characteristic functions, one can say the predicate’s reference just is that function. This gets technical, but the takeaway is that sense and reference pervade the language at every level, ensuring that each part of a sentence contributes to determining the truth-value of the whole. Frege’s whole logical system was built on this idea: you evaluate a complex formula by knowing the references of its parts. Yet, at the end of the day, if you want to know what the formula *means*, you must consider its sense, the thought, which is built from the senses of the parts in a parallel way.

One might wonder, do we really always care about the *sense*? In everyday speech, if I say “Venus is a planet,” I’m usually just trying to convey a fact about a thing in the world (Venus). Frege would say yes, but what allows you to convey that fact is precisely that your words have sense – a hearer grasps the sense and thereby is able to locate the referent. The sense is like the path and the referent the destination. Two different paths can lead to the same place; two different senses can determine the same referent. Frege has an apt line: *“The regular connection between a sign, its sense, and its reference is of such a kind that to the sign there corresponds a definite sense and to that in turn a definite reference”* ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=The%20regular%20connexion%20between%20a,totality%20of%20signs%2C%20there%20should)). That is the ideal situation in a well-functioning language: each proper name expresses one sense and designates one object; each object may have many names (with different senses), but each sense is associated with at most one object. Natural languages often deviate from this ideal (a name like “Aristotle” might evoke different senses to different people, for example), but the ideal can be approximated. Frege acknowledges that **“the same sense has different expressions in different languages… one must be content if the same word has the same sense in the same context”** ([Frege: ON SENSE AND REFERENCE](https://philosophy.ucsc.edu/courses/images/Frege_%20ON%20SENSE%20AND%20REFERENCE.pdf#:~:text=there%20corresponds%20a%20definite%20sense,this%20condition%2C%20and%20one%20must)) in everyday use. In a perfect language (such as his concept-script aimed to be), each expression would have a fixed sense and fixed reference.

Frege’s distinction has proved to be one of the most enduring ideas in analytic philosophy. Later philosophers have modified, critiqued, or built on it (Russell’s theory of descriptions, for instance, took a different route for certain cases; modern theories of reference sometimes downplay senses). But Frege’s basic insight—that what a term refers to is not the whole story of what it means—remains deeply influential. It opened up the possibility of discussing meaning in a structured way: we can now ask about the cognitive value (sense) versus the truth-conditions (reference) of a statement. Frege gave us the vocabulary to say, for example, that two sentences can be **coreferential** (refer to the same state of affairs) but express different **propositions** (senses). Philosophers of language still debate the details, but they do so largely in Frege’s terms.

In Frege’s own writing, the notion of *Bedeutung* (meaning or reference) and *Sinn* (sense) was also tied to his scientific objectives. By clearly distinguishing when he was talking about an expression’s sense versus its reference, he could avoid logical confusions. For example, Frege pointed out that a **scientific law** like “Heat is molecular motion” is not saying that a sign is a sign (that the word “heat” = the phrase “molecular motion”), but that the *referent* of “heat” (the phenomenon of heat) is the same object as the referent of “molecular motion.” This seems obvious once stated, but in an earlier era philosophers might have tangled themselves up arguing whether the *ideas* are the same or different. Frege’s apparatus cleanly separates these levels.

Finally, it’s worth noting Frege’s own modesty in presenting these ideas. In the 1892 paper, he builds up gently from examples, using clear language. The paper begins with the identity puzzle and moves step by step. By the time he introduces *Sinn* and *Bedeutung* explicitly, the reader has been prepared by examples. This style of careful analysis, beginning with a puzzle and ending with a theoretical distinction, has become a staple of analytic philosophy – one can say Frege’s *On Sense and Reference* is an archetypal example of the method. It reads almost like a short story in which a mystery is resolved by drawing a new distinction. Frege closes that essay by examining the sentence “Euler discovered the square root of 1” (which is odd-sounding because the square root of 1 is not an object that one *discovers*; his point is to show how mixing up sense and reference can lead to category errors). He ends on a technical note, but the big picture is clear: **every meaningful expression lights up two aspects – what it *says* and what it *picks out*** – and confusing the two is a source of many philosophical conundrums.

## Concept and Object

In Frege’s logical ontology, there is a strict divide between **Concepts** and **Objects**. This distinction is another cornerstone of his thought, one he implored readers to keep in mind always ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=There%20must%20be%20a%20sharp,principle%20is%20not%20observed%2C%20then)). But Frege’s use of the terms “concept” and “object” doesn’t map neatly onto everyday usage. It’s a technical distinction born from his function-argument analysis of propositions. An **Object** (Objekt) in Frege’s sense is any **complete, self-contained entity** – something that can be referred to by a proper name or noun phrase and cannot have an “empty slot” in it. A **Concept** (Begriff), by contrast, is an **incomplete, or unsaturated entity** – it is like a function that has a placeholder waiting to be filled by an object. Concepts are essentially *predicates* seen from the semantic side: a concept is something that can be true of an object. For example, the property of being a planet is a concept in Frege’s sense: it’s not a complete thing, but a condition that objects may or may not satisfy. One can’t talk about the concept “__ is a planet” as if it were an object without something going awry.

Frege grapples with this in *“On Concept and Object”* (1892), an article specifically written to clarify this point, partly in response to a misunderstanding by the philosopher Benno Kerry. In that essay, Frege drops one of his most paradoxical-sounding statements: **“the concept *horse* is not a concept.”** This perplexing claim is a prime example of Frege’s acknowledgment of an “awkwardness of language” ([logic - Is Horse a Concept? - Philosophy Stack Exchange](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/12772/is-horse-a-concept#:~:text=,must%20go%20proxy%20for%20it)). On the face of it, it seems contradictory: if anything should be a concept, wouldn’t the concept *horse* be one? But Frege’s point is subtle. The phrase “the concept *horse*” is grammatically a singular term – it behaves like a name for an object. And indeed, Frege says, when we use that phrase, we are actually referring to an *object* (in fact, presumably the extension of the concept horse, or some representative object that “goes proxy” for the concept). The **concept as such cannot be named directly as a concept in a sentence; it can only be expressed via a predicate**. If I say “Pegasus is a horse,” I am applying the concept *horse* to an object (Pegasus). But if I try to make the concept itself the subject – “The concept horse is ___” – I have already turned it into a linguistic object. Frege explains: **“One would expect that the reference of the grammatical subject [in the sentence ‘the concept horse is not a concept’] would be the concept; but the concept as such cannot play this part, in view of its predicative nature; it must first be converted into an object, or, more precisely, an object must go proxy for it.”** ([logic - Is Horse a Concept? - Philosophy Stack Exchange](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/12772/is-horse-a-concept#:~:text=,must%20go%20proxy%20for%20it)) In short, when we talk *about* a concept, we inevitably treat it as an object, which means we are no longer talking about it *in the way a concept truly is*. This is the “awkwardness of language” Frege mentions: our language doesn’t allow us to easily say what we mean in such cases without circumlocution, because concepts aren’t the kind of thing you can point to with a noun. They are inherently unsaturated, needing to latch onto an object.

Frege underscores that a **concept is predicative, unsaturated**, while an **object is self-contained, saturated**. In *Function and Concept* (1891), he had already drawn this distinction in functional terms. There he wrote, for example, **“an object is anything that is not a function, so that an expression for it does not contain any empty place.”** ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=and%20values%20of%20functions%2C%20the,values%20are%20objects)) A concept, being a kind of function (one that yields a truth value when given an object), always has an empty slot – it awaits an argument. The concept *__ is a horse* can never be an object in Frege’s strict sense, because it’s not a complete entity – it’s more like a template. But if we speak of “the concept *horse*” as if it were a thing, we are actually referring to something like the extension of that concept (the set of all horses, which *is* an object in Frege’s universe). Frege would say the phrase “the concept *horse*” is a misleading way to try to talk about a concept, and it actually denotes an object (the extension).

In daily terms, think of the difference between a *property* and a *thing*. “Horse” as a noun refers to a thing (an object), but “__ is a horse” refers to a property or condition (a concept). Frege’s strict ontology says: never confuse the two. If you have a property, you can’t treat it as a thing without losing its property-hood. The statement “the concept *horse* is not a concept” can then be paraphrased as: *“what the phrase ‘the concept horse’ designates is actually an object, not a concept.”* It’s a tongue-twister, but it taught logicians to be very careful about levels of language (in some sense it prefigures later ideas about use vs. mention, or type distinctions to avoid paradoxes).

Another way Frege illustrates the concept–object distinction is by pointing out that **a statement (a complete proposition) has a reference that is an object** (in fact, a truth-value, as we saw). *“A statement contains no empty place, and therefore we must take its Bedeutung (reference) as an object. But this Bedeutung is a truth-value. Thus the two truth-values are objects.”* ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=an%20object%20is%20anything%20that,e2)) ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=A%20statement%20contains%20no%20empty,the%20left%20of%20the%20%27equals)) This was a surprising claim of Frege’s: *The True* and *The False*, he said, are objects (logical objects, in fact so basic that there are only two of them). Concepts, on the other hand, are not objects; they can’t be picked up or counted or pointed to — only their extensions (which are objects like sets) can. Frege even remarks, as we saw, that an **extension of a concept** (what he calls a *value-range*) *is* an object, **“although concepts themselves are not.”** ([](https://fitelson.org/proseminar/frege_fac.pdf#:~:text=functions%20are%20objects%2C%20whereas%20functions,be%20taken%20as%20argu%02ments%2C%20we)) The extension of the concept *horse* (roughly the set of all horses) is an object; the concept *horse* (the condition of being a horse) is not an object but a function. This distinction helped Frege avoid certain logical pitfalls. For example, consider the concept *is a concept*. If we naively ask “Does the concept *horse* fall under the concept *is a concept*?”, we get into trouble because to even talk about “the concept horse” we had to objectify it. Modern readers might see connections to Russell’s paradox or type theory here: Frege is intuitively aware that a concept cannot consistently apply to itself or to other concepts in an unrestrained way without higher-order machinery. In his system, concepts apply to objects, and **only to objects**. A first-level concept (like *is a horse*, which applies to individual objects) cannot apply to a first-level concept (it can’t apply to *is a mammal*, for instance, because *is a mammal* is not an object). There are second-level concepts that apply to first-level concepts (like *is a concept applied to an object* could be a second-level concept that concepts either satisfy or not), but Frege would handle that as a separate logical type. The overarching message: keep categories straight — concept to the left, object to the right, and never the two shall mis-mate.

Frege’s strictness on this point may seem pedantic, but it is part of what allowed him to avoid certain incoherencies. By enforcing that any grammatical subject in a well-formed sentence denote an object, and predicates denote concepts, Frege’s logic set a clear hierarchy. It’s analogous to the idea in programming that data of one type shouldn’t be shoved into a slot expecting another type. Frege lacked the modern terminology, but he essentially implemented a *type discipline* in logic: objects versus concepts (of various levels) are different types of entity. The “concept horse” paradox was a warning of what happens if one ignores the discipline: you end up saying nonsense like “a concept is not a concept” because you tried to treat a concept as an object.

So, how do we talk about concepts if we can’t name them directly? Frege’s answer: we usually talk about them by using predicate expressions. When I say “the concept of being a horse is a species concept,” on the surface I’m using a nominalization “the concept of being a horse,” which is indeed a singular term (an object referring to a concept). Frege would parse that as really talking about an object that corresponds to the concept (perhaps a second-level concept that that first-level concept falls under, or the extension of the concept). It’s tricky, but basically Frege would encourage us to reformulate statements to avoid treating concepts as objects whenever possible. For example, instead of saying “the concept horse is widespread,” one might say “many objects fall under the concept *horse*.” The latter formulation respects the idea that *horse* applies to objects (those many objects), rather than trying to pin “widespreadness” directly onto the concept.

In Frege’s system of logic, a lot of these issues were handled implicitly by the formal syntax: one sort of variable (usually lowercase Latin letters) ranged over objects, another sort (Greek letters or special markers) ranged over functions or concepts. His notation and inference rules kept those apart. The philosophical exposition in “On Concept and Object” was his effort to explain these constraints in words. He notes toward the end of that essay that his readers might find it strange that he denies that “the concept horse” is a concept, but he says, in essence: trust me, it’s the language that’s clumsy here, not the logic. Indeed, he adds: *“We must always be on our guard against equating the **meaning** of a sentence with the **psychological idea** it produces… and just as carefully must we distinguish between concept and object.”* For Frege, **logical clarity demanded these sharp lines**.

The concept–object divide also underlies Frege’s treatment of number, as we saw. When he says a number statement is about a *concept*, he relies on us understanding what a concept is (a predicate, a property) and what an object is. The number 4, in “There are 4 horses,” is a property of the concept *horse*. If one blurred concept and object, one might mistakenly think the number was describing an object (like a collection or something) rather than characterizing a concept’s extension. Frege avoided this by never letting concepts “act” like objects in his formulas. 

To sum up, Frege’s concept/object distinction asserts a **fundamental duality** in the logical universe: **Objects** are the things we talk about (individuals, truth-values, numbers, sets – all treated as objects in his system); **Concepts** are what we express via predicates and which *hold* or *do not hold* of objects. A concept can never be an object, and an object can never be a concept – they are “incommutable” categories. If this sounds reminiscent of Kant’s distinction between objects of intuition vs concepts of understanding, that’s not accidental – Frege was influenced by but also critical of Kant. Frege naturalizes that distinction into his logic: an object is like something that can be given (though not necessarily sensibly), a concept is like a rule or property. 

There is also a kinship to Plato’s forms vs particulars, but Frege’s spin is unique because some abstracta (like numbers or truth-values) count as objects for him, whereas concepts are more akin to Platonic forms in their generality – except even Platonic forms in Plato’s own metaphysics might be considered objects in a higher sense. Frege’s realm of concepts is more like a realm of functions that are defined on objects. Today we might visualize a two-layer ontology: a base layer of objects, and a layer of unary functions (concepts) mapping objects to truth-values. Frege elevates truth-values to objects to close the loop (since concepts yield objects as outputs). The consistency and power of this setup is evidenced by how Frege could develop arithmetic in it (until the set-theoretic issue intervened).

Frege’s tone in discussing these matters oscillates between dry technicality and flashes of candid admission about the limits of language. In “On Concept and Object,” after going through the “concept horse” puzzle, he remarks that it *“cannot be helped: we are indeed confronted by an awkwardness of language”* that forces us into such locutions ([logic - Is Horse a Concept? - Philosophy Stack Exchange](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/12772/is-horse-a-concept#:~:text=,must%20go%20proxy%20for%20it)). There is almost a hint of resignation in that phrase — he knows it sounds weird, but he’s convinced it’s the truth. This is characteristic of Frege: he is uncompromising with logic, even if ordinary intuition or language feels a pinch. His hope, however, was that by being so exact about these distinctions, we can avoid serious paradoxes and errors. And largely he was right; most of the logical paradoxes that plagued naive theories (like various set-theoretic and semantic paradoxes) stem from some sort of category mistake or self-reference that a strict Fregean typing tries to prevent.

In everyday terms, we might say *Frege draws a line between “being something” and “having something.”* An object *is something* (it exists, we can talk about it), a concept *has something* (a property that objects can have). If I say “Alice is wise,” Alice is the object, wisdom is the concept that she falls under. If I say “Wisdom is important,” I’m turning wisdom itself into an object of discourse (probably meaning the concept of wisdom is an important concept). Frege would rewrite “Wisdom is important” as something like “The pursuit of wisdom is important” or “For all x, if x is wise then x fares better in life” or something that avoids treating the concept as the subject. These rewrites make the implicit object (people, or pursuit) explicit.

To conclude this section, we might reflect on how Frege’s rigor on the concept/object distinction influenced later analytic philosophy. Carnap and the logical positivists, for instance, inherited the idea of type distinctions and the inadmissibility of certain statements as ill-formed. Later, Quine critiqued some of these distinctions (famously quipping about “Plato’s beard” – the idea that being so strict invites strange entities like The Concept Horse or The Round Square). But in computer science and mathematics, something very akin to Frege’s regime became standard in type theory and formal semantics. Russell’s type theory in *Principia Mathematica* can be seen as an elaboration of Frege’s insight that one shouldn’t mix levels (though Russell arrived at it partly via the paradox Frege’s system encountered). In a sense, Frege pioneered a disciplined ontology where every meaningful statement respects a kind of logical grammar of types.

Frege’s universe, then, is neatly divided: on one side, individual objects (including abstract ones like numbers and truth-values); on the other, concepts (and more generally functions) that yield truth-values when applied to objects. And never shall the two sides be confused – a principle he enshrined, sometimes with paradoxical phrasing, to ensure we don’t “step outside logic” by saying something nonsensical. It is a testament to Frege’s intellectual integrity that he would rather speak a seemingly self-contradictory sentence (“the concept horse is not a concept”) than allow a genuine logical mistake (treating a concept as an object) to pass unnoticed. His sacrifice of linguistic comfort for the sake of clarity of thought is one of those Fregean traits that make his work challenging but deeply rewarding: he teaches us to listen to what our sentences are really doing, and to reshape them if they silently betray the very distinctions we need to keep. 

## Conclusion: Frege’s Unified Vision

Tracing these themes – the architecture of logic, the nature of number, the relation of thought and language, the sense/reference distinction, the concept/object divide – we see a unified vision emerging. Frege was, above all, a thinker who **trusted in the power of precise logical analysis** to illuminate age-old philosophical problems. He believed that by attending scrupulously to the structure of language and the structure of thought, one could untangle confusions that had persisted for centuries. In Frege’s own time, his work was not widely recognized; it took a younger generation (Russell, Wittgenstein, Carnap) to publicize and build upon his achievements. Today, however, Frege is rightly regarded as one of the founding figures of analytic philosophy and modern logic. His *Begriffsschrift* was the birth of modern predicate logic. *The Foundations of Arithmetic* was a template for rigorous philosophical argument, as he scrutinized every assumption about number. *“On Sense and Reference”* has become a staple of semantics courses, and *“On Concept and Object”* a warning flag for semantic pitfalls. His 1918 essays on thought and truth strike a chord even now, in an era wrestling with relativisms and subjectivities, by upholding an ideal of objectivity and shared meaning.

Throughout his works, Frege’s own words convey a mix of passion for truth and sober recognition of difficulty. We sense his frustration when he writes that after so much effort, an issue remains *“so unclear about its most prominent object, which is apparently so simple. Small wonder that no one can say what number is.”* ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=11%20%3D%201%20asserts%20nothing,difficulties%2C%20then%20it%20is%20surely)) (He then proceeds to remedy that, as best he can.) We also sense his intellectual humility – for instance, when he acknowledges that his approach to a universal characteristic *“could not go beyond the bare preliminaries”* of Leibniz’s giant project, but he does not despair: *“even if this worthy goal cannot be reached in one leap, we need not despair of a slow, step-by-step approximation.”* ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=Leibniz%2C%20too%2C%20recognized%E2%80%94and%20perhaps%20overrated%E2%80%94the,bring%20about%20led%20him%20to)) ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=underestimate%20the%20difficulties%20that%20stand,step)) This could serve as a motto for Frege’s own work: step by step approximation to an ideal of perfect logical clarity.

Frege’s unified vision can be summed up in a few key convictions:

- **Logic is the bedrock of all science.** It provides the framework in which truths of any domain must ultimately be expressible and justified. Hence, improving logic (as Frege did with his concept-script) extends our capacity for knowledge in general. *“All great steps of scientific progress in recent times have had their origin in an improvement of method,”* Frege notes ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=of%20method%2C%20too%2C%20furthers%20science,)), aligning his work with that ethos.

- **Mathematics, especially arithmetic, is a paradigm of logical thought.** Frege’s logicism was not a fanciful reduction; it was borne of the realization that arithmetic propositions, if properly formulated, make no reference to sensible intuition and could be derived from general laws. This was a striking departure from Kant, who had held that arithmetic was synthetic *a priori* (thus needing intuition). Frege sought to show it was analytic *a priori*, i.e. derivable from logic and definitions. While his specific system encountered a notorious obstacle, the quest he set – to understand how our knowledge of numbers is grounded – profoundly influenced mathematics (leading eventually to developments like set theory, Gödel’s work, and beyond).

- **The meaning of an expression is twofold, and understanding requires grasping sense as well as reference.** This gentle analytical knife allowed Frege to separate concerns and resolve puzzles. It anticipates so much of later analytic philosophy: the distinction between *what* is said and *how* it’s said, between cognitive content and external truth conditions, between what’s in the head and what’s in the world. 

- **Thoughts are objective.** In an age where psychology was coming to the fore (and indeed, early 20th-century philosophy saw many psychologistic tendencies), Frege stood firm that logic and truth are not matters of psychology. *“There is no contradiction in saying that a proposition of the first kind [provable by logic alone] could not have come to consciousness in a human mind without any activity of the senses… it is not the psychological genesis but the best method of proof”* that matters ([Gottlob Frege Begriffsschrift ( English)](https://archive.org/download/gottlob-frege-begriffsschrift-english/Gottlob%20Frege%20-%20Begriffsschrift%20%28English%29_text.pdf#:~:text=laws%20upon%20which%20all%20knowledge,human%20mind%20without%20any%20activity)). He separates how we come to *think* of something from what it takes to *prove* it logically. This separation of the context of discovery from the context of justification is a hallmark of rational inquiry and was central to Frege’s methodology.

- **Precision in language reflects precision in thought.** Frege’s sometimes stilted prose and his exacting notation were in service of a belief that many philosophical dilemmas are pseudo-problems arising from imprecise language. If we can express ourselves with the right distinctions (concept vs object, sense vs reference, etc.), confusion dissipates. Consider how Frege dispatched the metaphysical worry “Are numbers objects or concepts?” – a question that could be debated endlessly. His answer: the *word* “four” is an object (reference) that is asserted of a *concept* (like *__ is a moon of Jupiter*) in “Jupiter has four moons.” The philosophical anxiety (is number something out there or just a property?) is defused by a precise analysis of the grammar of “four.” In Frege’s hands, philosophical problems are often solved by *logic and semantics* rather than by speculative metaphysics.

In a New Yorker–style essay such as this, we have walked through Frege’s intellectual edifice room by room, hearing his own voice resonate. The atmosphere is one of extreme clarity: the air in Frege’s house of logic is crisp and cold, every corner illuminated by a steady white light of reason. It can be bracing to breathe that air – Frege permits no haze of half-formed idea, no cozy warmth of intuitive handwaving. But once one acclimates, one sees the vista he was pointing towards: an alpine view where mathematics and philosophy meet, high above the clouds of confusion. Frege’s influence on the analytic tradition is sometimes compared to a seismic shift: he reoriented how we approach language, thought, and logic. By quoting him at length, we have tried to let Frege speak for himself in all his rigor. The rewards of following his thought are the moments when a hard problem suddenly seems startlingly clear. To close with Frege’s own aim as he expressed it in the *Grundlagen*: **“I cherish the hope that even philosophers will find something useful in the present work, if they examine it without prejudice.”** ([](https://sshieh.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2013f/388/e-texts/Frege%20Selections%20from%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic.pdf#:~:text=his%20theory%20of%20knowledge,)) Indeed, the usefulness of Frege’s work has echoed through philosophy for over a century. Examining it without prejudice – or perhaps with the sympathetic patience we have attempted here – reveals an intellect of the highest order, constructing a unified vision where **logic, language, and reality** align. In Frege’s universe, to understand anything – a number, a statement, a concept – is ultimately to see how it fits into the logical structure of the world. And through his eyes, that structure comes into focus with unprecedented clarity, every thought in its proper place, every concept bound to its object, and truth standing as the guiding star of our intellectual efforts.
