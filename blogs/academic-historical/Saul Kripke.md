Great—I'll dig into all of Saul Kripke's published works, including his books, lectures, and collected papers. The goal is to synthesize his original thoughts in their raw form, thematically, with extensive quotations and analysis. I'll write it in the style of a longform essay, weaving his philosophical themes and breakthroughs together like an investigative literary profile, using only the texts themselves and respected academic commentary—no modern gloss. I'll let you know when the deep-dive is ready.

# Introduction

In 1970, a 29-year-old Saul Kripke stepped to the podium at Princeton and delivered three lectures that **“shook up Anglo-American philosophy”** ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=In%201970%2C%20the%20philosopher%20Saul,transformed%20each%2C%20and%20resuscitated%20metaphysics)). Speaking without notes, the young logician wove together strands of modal logic, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of mind in a way that, as one listener put it, **“transformed each, and resuscitated metaphysics”** ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=In%201970%2C%20the%20philosopher%20Saul,transformed%20each%2C%20and%20resuscitated%20metaphysics)). Those talks became *Naming and Necessity* (1980), a slender book that would cement Kripke’s reputation as one of the great philosophers of the 20th century. In the decades that followed, through lectures and essays rather than voluminous tomes, Kripke continued to upend orthodoxies. He puzzled over how names hook onto reality, how identity can be necessary yet known *a posteriori*, whether rules and meanings are fixed by any fact at all, and how truth might consistently refer to itself. His writing—often transcribed from unscripted talks—retained a conversational clarity even as it dug into deep philosophical mysteries. This long-form essay will trace the major themes of Kripke’s work *in his own philosophical idiom*, drawing extensively on his texts (*Naming and Necessity; Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language; Reference and Existence;* and *Philosophical Troubles*, among others) and on scholarly interpretations. Rather than summarizing each work in isolation, we will follow the interconnected threads: reference and naming, necessity and possibility, rule-following and meaning, semantics and truth, identity and mind. The aim is to distill Kripke’s essence—his original arguments, examples, and style of thought—by letting him speak for himself as much as possible, with context provided by those who have studied his philosophy. 

## The Revolution in Naming and Reference

Kripke’s first great contribution was a new theory of how words—especially names—attach to the world. *Naming and Necessity* opens with what seems an abstruse question: *How does a name refer to a particular individual, whether present, distant, or even long dead?* The prevailing mid-century view (inherited from Frege and Russell) was that a name is essentially a disguised description. On this description theory, “Aristotle” might just mean *the ancient Greek philosopher who taught Alexander the Great*, and to know what the name means is to know that description ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=According%20to%20then%20standard%20views%2C,might%20have%20been%20called%20Robert)). Kripke disagreed. He invites us to consider that if the description theory were right, certain statements would become trivial tautologies (for example, “Aristotle was a philosopher in ancient Greece” would simply affirm Aristotle was Aristotle) ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=According%20to%20then%20standard%20views%2C,might%20have%20been%20called%20Robert)), and it would be incoherent to say things like “Aristotle might not have been a philosopher” (since the name would *mean* philosopher) ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=According%20to%20then%20standard%20views%2C,might%20have%20been%20called%20Robert)). Yet such counterfactual statements make perfect sense. We can imagine Aristotle *not* being a philosopher (perhaps a political figure instead), or even imagine that someone *other than* Aristotle wrote the works attributed to him ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=done,might%20have%20been%20called%20Robert)). Clearly, Kripke observes, a name does **not** simply abbreviate a bundle of known descriptions. 

In Kripke’s view, names refer in a more direct, *causal* way. He asks us to picture the use of a name as a kind of historical chain. **“A baby is born; his parents call him by a certain name. They talk about him to their friends. Other people meet him. Through various sorts of talk the name is spread from link to link as if by a chain”** ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=Names%20could%20hardly%20be%20fixed,chain%E2%80%9D%20across%20time%20and%20space)). At the end of this chain stand we, the present speakers, who can use the name *in virtue of our connection to others in the community, going back to the referent himself* ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=is%20spread%20from%20link%20to,chain%E2%80%9D%20across%20time%20and%20space)). What fixes reference is not the speaker’s private mental image or description, but rather this public chain of communication. Kripke emphasizes: **“for most speakers, unless they are the ones who initially give an object its name, the referent of the name is determined by a ‘causal’ chain of communication rather than a description.”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=for%20most%20speakers%2C%20unless%20they,term%20t%20is%20usually%20taken)) In other words, I can refer to **Richard Nixon** successfully even if I know almost nothing about him, purely because I’ve heard the name through reliable channels originating with Nixon himself ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=is%20spread%20from%20link%20to,chain%E2%80%9D%20across%20time%20and%20space)). As Kripke puts it, **“it is not how the speaker thinks he got the reference”** that determines what he is referring to ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=is%20spread%20from%20link%20to,chain%E2%80%9D%20across%20time%20and%20space)). 

This causal-historical picture contrasts sharply with the earlier Frege–Russell “sense and reference” picture. On the old view, different people might associate different senses (descriptive meanings) with a name like “Aristotle,” so arguably they’d be using the name with different meanings. Kripke rejects that: he suggests that the meaning of a name isn’t a bundle of properties at all, but the *object* itself. He introduces the term **“rigid designator.”** A rigid designator is a term that designates the *same object in all possible worlds* in which the object exists ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=Waiving%20fussy%20considerations%20deriving%20from,the%20state%02ment%20%27a%20%3D%20b)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=not%20have%20been%20Hesperus,names%20are%20always%20rigid%20designators)). Kripke’s bold thesis is that ordinary proper names (like *Aristotle, Nixon, Hesperus*) are rigid designators ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=position%27%20does%20not,names%20are%20always%20rigid%20designators)). When we use a name, we aim to pick out the same individual in any counterfactual scenario. For example, consider the evening star **Hesperus** (which turned out to be the planet Venus). If we imagine a counterfactual situation where Venus was knocked off course by a comet, we would say *“Hesperus would not have appeared in the evening sky”*, but we wouldn’t say *“Hesperus would not have been Hesperus.”* Why? **“The reason is that ‘Hesperus’ rigidly designates a certain heavenly body and ‘the body in yonder position’ does not – a different body, or no body, might have been in that position, but no other body might have been Hesperus”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=counterfactual%20situation%20we%20would%20say,names%20are%20always%20rigid%20designators)). Another celestial example: ancient stargazers used two names, “Hesperus” for the evening star and “Phosphorus” for the morning star, not realizing they were the same planet. When they eventually discovered the truth, the identity statement *“Hesperus is Phosphorus”* expressed a genuine factual discovery. According to Kripke, this statement is true in virtue of the world (it turned out those celestial appearances were one object, Venus), but it does **not** follow that the name “Hesperus” *meant* “the star seen in the evening” (a descriptive sense). If it had, then saying *“Hesperus is Phosphorus”* would have been either false or trivial, which it wasn’t ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=that%20it%20is%20part%20of,In%20such%20a)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=not%20have%20been%20Hesperus,names%20are%20always%20rigid%20designators)). Instead, both “Hesperus” and “Phosphorus” rigidly pick out the planet Venus; the statement equates one rigid designator with another, which is informative but (as we shall see) turns out to be necessarily true if true at all. 

Kripke illustrates the difference between his view and the descriptivist view with imaginative cases. Suppose the biblical **Moses** existed but never actually did any of the deeds recorded in scripture; someone else led the Exodus, received the Ten Commandments, etc. Would it follow that “Moses did not exist”? According to a description theory (where “Moses” means *the man who did such-and-such*), if no one fulfilled those deeds, then indeed *“Moses”* would refer to nothing, and the sentence “Moses did not exist” would be analytically true. But Kripke urges us to resist that: **“we can ask, if in a counterfactual case no one did indeed do such-and-such – say, lead the Israelites out of Egypt – does it follow that, in such a situation, Moses wouldn’t have existed? It would seem not. For surely Moses might have just decided to spend his days more pleasantly in the Egyptian courts…That doesn’t in itself mean that in such a possible world Moses wouldn’t have existed”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=then%2C%20if%20no%20one%20did,He%20might%20never%20have)). The name “Moses” would still refer to the same man (the very man who in the actual world did those deeds), even though in that alternate scenario he accomplished none of the identifying descriptions. This shows, Kripke argues, that names are not synonymous with descriptions; rather, a description can be used *to fix the reference* of a name initially, but once the name is attached, it rigidly sticks to that individual ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=a%20name%20via%20a%20description,acquainted%3B%20and%20it%20is%20precisely)). As he succinctly puts it: **“If ‘a’ and ‘b’ are rigid designators, it follows that ‘a = b’, if true, is a necessary truth”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=Waiving%20fussy%20considerations%20deriving%20from,the%20state%02ment%20%27a%20%3D%20b)). And conversely, if the designators are non-rigid (like definite descriptions), no such necessity follows ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=Waiving%20fussy%20considerations%20deriving%20from,the%20state%02ment%20%27a%20%3D%20b)). 

Kripke’s “causal chain” theory of naming thus retains what was attractive in the older Millian view (that a name simply refers to its bearer and doesn’t *mean* anything else) while explaining how reference gets established and passed along. A “rough statement” of the theory goes like this: **“An initial ‘baptism’ takes place. Here the object may be named by ostension, or the reference of the name may be fixed by a description… When the name is ‘passed from link to link,’ the receiver of the name must, I think, intend when he learns it to use it with the same reference as the man from whom he heard it.”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=A%20rough%20statement%20of%20a,failure%20to%20keep%20the%20reference)) If someone along the chain fails to keep the reference (e.g. decides to use *“Napoleon”* as a new name for their pet aardvark), that diverging link doesn’t count ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=the%20receiver%20of%20the%20name,is%20to%20cases%20of%20initial)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=heard%20it,is%20to%20cases%20of%20initial)). But normally, if each speaker in the chain intends to refer as the previous speaker did, the name preserves its reference. Because of this causal continuity, we can refer to historical figures or distant places without needing any explicit description in our heads. Kripke notes that this account **“takes the notion of intending to use the same reference as a given”** and in fact *eliminates* any requirement that the speaker have a descriptive *sense* in mind ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=A%20rough%20statement%20of%20a,failure%20to%20keep%20the%20reference)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=heard%20it,is%20to%20cases%20of%20initial)). (A speaker might have some incorrect description in mind—maybe thinking “Nixon” means *the man who championed civil rights*—yet as long as they got the name from reliable sources, they still refer to Nixon, not to whoever fits that incorrect description.) 

One consequence of Kripke’s picture is that **empty names** (names with no actual bearer, like *Sherlock Holmes* or *Santa Claus*) present no special mystery: they simply fail to refer to any real object. Such names may still be meaningful in other ways (we can say meaningful things *within* the fiction), but there is no hidden referent or “possible object” that the name points to. Kripke insists that a fictional name is a *rigid non-designator*, an expression that *necessarily fails to refer* in the real world ([Names and Possible Objects - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2218910#:~:text=Names%20and%20Possible%20Objects%20,As%20Kripke%20says%20of%20%27Sherlock)). *Sherlock Holmes*, for instance, does not secretly name some possible-but-nonactual person; as Kripke drily notes, talking about Holmes is not truly about *any* individual, and in an important sense Holmes **“might have been said to designate nothing, or only pretend to...**” ([Names and Possible Objects - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2218910#:~:text=Names%20and%20Possible%20Objects%20,As%20Kripke%20says%20of%20%27Sherlock)). (Kripke’s later John Locke Lectures, published as *Reference and Existence* (2013), explore this topic in detail, arguing that we can make true statements about fictional characters in a story without committing ourselves to any mysterious nonexistent objects ([Names and Possible Objects - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2218910#:~:text=Names%20and%20Possible%20Objects%20,As%20Kripke%20says%20of%20%27Sherlock)).) 

## Rigid Designators, Identity, and Necessary Truths

Along with a new theory of reference, *Naming and Necessity* introduced a startling idea about **modality** (necessity and possibility): namely, that some statements are *necessarily true* even though they can only be known by empirical discovery. In Kripke’s framework, once a name’s reference is fixed, it rigidly denotes the same entity in all possible worlds. It follows that if we discover an identity between two referents, that identity—being an identity between one thing and itself—must hold in every possible world where those things exist. Thus Kripke famously argued that **identity statements using names (or other rigid designators) are metaphysically necessary, if true** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=Waiving%20fussy%20considerations%20deriving%20from,the%20state%02ment%20%27a%20%3D%20b)), even when they are not obvious a priori. For example, consider the true identity statement *“Hesperus (Venus) is Phosphorus (Venus)”*. Before it was known, this was a genuine question (ancient astronomers weren’t sure if the morning star was the same as the evening star). So the statement was established *a posteriori* (through observation). But once it’s true, according to Kripke, it’s true in all possible worlds: it could not have turned out *false*, because Hesperus *is* Phosphorus – they’re one object, Venus – and a thing is necessarily itself. In general, if *a = b* and *a* and *b* are rigid designators, then there is no possible situation in which *a* isn’t *b*. We are discovering a fact about the actual world, but it’s a fact about the *identity* of one thing with another, which, if true, holds across every counterfactual scenario. Kripke writes: **“If ‘a’ and ‘b’ are rigid designators, ... ‘a = b’, if true, is a necessary truth”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=Waiving%20fussy%20considerations%20deriving%20from,the%20state%02ment%20%27a%20%3D%20b)). Conversely, if two names refer to different things, then *a = b* is false in *all* worlds. The only caveat is if a name might refer to nothing in some world (for instance, if the object might not have existed); but that doesn’t make a true identity contingent, it just means in some counterfactual scenario one or both names lack a referent.

This idea – the **necessary a posteriori** – was revolutionary. For centuries, philosophers had assumed that if something is known *a posteriori* (through experience), it must be *contingent* (true in some worlds, false in others). And conversely, if something is *necessary*, it must be knowable *a priori*. Kripke overturned that orthodoxy by giving clear examples of statements that are both empirically discovered and yet, given the nature of reference, could not have been false. **“Theoretical identities, according to the conception I advocate, are generally identities involving two rigid designators and therefore are examples of the necessary *a posteriori*.”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=therefore%20are%20examples%20of%20the,Someone%20may%20well%20be)) A classic example is *“Water is H₂O.”* Humans had to discover through science that the liquid we call water has the molecular structure H₂O. Before that discovery, it was an open empirical question, not something knowable from pure reason. Yet *if* water is H₂O, Kripke argues, then in every possible world where water exists at all, it must be H₂O (because *“water”* rigidly refers to that substance, not to “whatever clear liquid fills the lakes”). We can imagine a world where some *other* liquid fills the oceans – but that wouldn’t be *water*, it would be a different substance. So although it was conceivable *epistemically* before the discovery that water might not be H₂O, in reality there’s no metaphysically possible world where water ≠ H₂O, given that “water” means that very stuff. Similarly, *“Heat is molecular motion”* (the kinetic theory of heat) or *“Lightning is an electrical discharge”* are identities discovered by science that, if true, hold with necessity ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=therefore%20are%20examples%20of%20the,Someone%20may%20well%20be)). 

Kripke acknowledges that this notion of a posteriori necessity is initially *“somewhat puzzling.”* After all, one might object: didn’t we *learn* that heat is molecular motion? It **“might have turned out** not to be true,” someone could argue, “that heat = motion of molecules”. Kripke’s response is subtle: he distinguishes between what’s **metaphysically possible** and what’s **epistemically possible** for us. Before we knew the kinetic theory, it was *epistemically* possible (for all we knew) that heat was something else. But in the actual world, heat turned out to be molecular motion – and *that very phenomenon* (heat) could not have been anything else once we fix what we’re talking about. We should not confuse our state of knowledge with the modal status of the fact itself. As he puts it, a necessary truth *“could not have turned out otherwise”*, but **“under appropriate qualitatively identical evidential situations, an observer could have been led to believe a qualitatively analogous statement that was false.”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=follows%3A%20Any%20necessary%20truth%2C%20whether,qualitatively%20identical%20evidential%20situations%2C%20an)) In other words, someone in a different world could have experienced sensations just like our heat sensations but coming from a different source – and they might have called that “heat” and been wrong about its nature. But *our* term “heat” in the actual world rigidly refers to *this* phenomenon, which is molecular motion, and no counterfactual scenario about a different phenomenon can make the identity false **for this world** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=learn%20a%20mathematical%20truth%20a,is%20necessary%3B%20for%20the%20peculiar)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=All%20the%20cases%20of%20the,knowledge%20of%20their%20truth%20is)). Kripke thus shows how one can consistently hold that *“all the cases of the necessary a posteriori”* are such that **“philosophical analysis tells us that they cannot be contingently true, so any empirical knowledge of their truth is also knowledge of their necessity.”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L6674%20All%20the,knowledge%20of%20their%20truth%20is)) 

Hand in hand with rigid designation and the necessary a posteriori comes a revival of **essence** in analytic philosophy. Kripke is careful to distinguish metaphysical necessity from mere linguistic or conceptual necessity. When he says a statement like “Aristotle was a philosopher” is not necessary (Aristotle *might* not have been a philosopher), he is implying Aristotle had no *essential* property of being a philosopher. But some properties do seem essential to things. The trick is identifying which. Kripke suggests that origin can be essential (it’s plausible that Aristotle could not have been born to entirely different parents) and that the chemical structure of a natural kind is essential to it. He uses intuitive tests: **gold** for instance, was first identified by certain appearances (yellow metal, etc.), but if we found a substance that had all the superficial appearances of gold yet was chemically different (say, fool’s gold, iron pyrite), we would not call it a kind of gold ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=it%20has%20all%20the%20appearances,which%20to%20the%20uninitiated%20person)). Why? Because being the element with atomic number 79 is an essential property of gold; anything that lacks that isn’t gold at all, no matter how much it glitters. Kripke humorously notes that before scientific chemistry, people implicitly *assumed* a kind of essence: **“Even before I clearly realized the true situation regarding proper names, I felt little sympathy for the doctrine of a relation of ‘contingent identity.’ Uniquely identifying properties *simultaneously* ascribed the object *both* a property that it could have lacked *and* made having that property a condition of its identity.”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=position%27%20does%20not,might%20be%20that%20this%20description)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=then%2C%20if%20no%20one%20did,existed%3F%20It%20would%20seem%20not)) In plainer terms, describing something as “the yellow metal here” and then asking “but what if it weren’t yellow?” is confused if being yellow was part of how you *defined* it. Kripke’s approach frees us from that confusion by separating how we *fix* a reference (e.g. “whatever metal is in this ring”) from what the thing turns out to be (gold, with all its actual properties). Once we know what it is, we can say in another possible world it might not have been yellow (maybe the alloy is different), but it’s still the same metal (still Au, atomic number 79). His semantic insights thus illuminate metaphysical notions of essence and necessity in a newly precise way.

Kripke did not shy away from the profound implications of necessary identities. In fact, he leveraged them to challenge the dominant theories in the **philosophy of mind** at the time. If names and natural kind terms rigidly designate their referents, then theoretical identities in science (like water = H₂O) are necessary when true. Kripke applies this reasoning to the identity theory of mind and brain. According to the identity theorists (like Smart or Armstrong in the 1960s), a mental state such as pain *just is* a certain physical state of the brain (say, C-fiber stimulation). They treated statements like “pain = C-fiber firing” as empirical, contingent truths, analogous to “lightning = electrical discharge.” But Kripke points out a crucial disanalogy: *pain* is not known by external observation; it’s known by how it **feels** from the inside. When we imagine the possibility of pain without C-fiber firing, or C-fiber firing without pain, we aren’t imagining a different *thing* (the way imagining lightning without electricity would really be imagining some other kind of phenomenon). We’re trying to imagine the same phenomenon (pain) in a world where it isn’t accompanied by the brain state. And it seems we *can* imagine that: one can conceive of a creature that has an identical brain state to pain (C-fiber stimulation) but feels nothing – a zombie of sorts – or a scenario where a being feels pain but has a different physiology. Kripke formulates the argument powerfully: Let **A** be a particular pain sensation you had, and **B** be the corresponding brain state (C-fiber firing) that an identity theorist claims is the same thing. **“Prima facie, it would seem that it is at least logically possible that B should have existed … without [anyone] feeling any pain at all, and thus without the presence of A,”** he writes ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=Let%20%27A%27%20name%20a%20particular,of%20the%20necessity%20of%20identities)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=using%20rigid%20designators%2C%20disallows%20any,pain%3F%20The%20identity%20theorist%20who)). But if A = B, the identity theory *cannot* allow that possibility: **“consistency, and the principle of the necessity of identities using rigid designators, disallows any such course. If A and B were identical, the identity would have to be necessary.”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=cannot%20admit%20the%20possibility%20cheerfully,Can%20any)) The only dodge for the materialist is to claim that *being a pain* is just a contingent property of that brain state B – i.e. B could exist without being a pain, even though in the actual world B is a pain. Kripke finds that absurd: **“Can any case of essence be more obvious than the fact that being a pain is a necessary property of each pain?”** ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=difficulty%20can%20hardly%20be%20evaded,pain%3F%20The%20identity%20theorist%20who)) If you have a particular pain in mind, can you imagine that *very pain* existing without being a pain (the way, say, the person Benjamin Franklin could have existed without being an inventor)? Of course not. The identity theorist’s strategy would require saying that the sensation’s *mental* property is somehow accidental, which robs the words of their meaning. Kripke concludes that if pains were identical to brain states, the identities would be necessary (you couldn’t have the brain state without the pain or vice versa) – but we *can* conceive them coming apart, so by modus tollens, pain is *not* identical to any particular brain state ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=using%20rigid%20designators%2C%20disallows%20any,pain%3F%20The%20identity%20theorist%20who)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=wishes,to%20me%20to%20be%20adopted)). This is sometimes called **Kripke’s modal argument against materialism**, and it had a huge impact on philosophy of mind. It suggested that no purely physical description can capture the subjective essence of pain (or other sensations), because if it did, that essence would have to hold in all possible worlds, and clearly it doesn’t. Kripke did **not** claim this “proof” was the final word on mind–body, but he did insist the identity theorist faces a severe modal paradox. Any supposed identity like “pain = C-fiber stimulation,” if true, should be *necessarily* true – and yet it doesn’t *seem* necessary in the way “water = H₂O” does (since we can’t coherently imagine H₂O without water, but we *can* imagine C-fibers firing without pain). By the lights of Kripke’s semantic insights, that indicates the “pain = brain state” thesis is false ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=consistency%2C%20and%20the%20principle%20of,pain%3F%20The%20identity%20theorist%20who)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=difficulty%20can%20hardly%20be%20evaded,B%20could%20exist%20without%20any)). Thus, *Naming and Necessity* not only changed philosophy of language and metaphysics, it also **“challenged ideas about the identity of mind and brain”** ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=Influential%20American%20philosopher%20whose%201980,identity%20of%20mind%20and%20brain)) and reinvigorated the debate over consciousness and materialism.

## The Skeptical Paradox of Rule-Following

In the early 1980s, Kripke turned his attention to Ludwig Wittgenstein’s later philosophy, producing a slender 1982 book that has proven nearly as influential—and controversial—as *Naming and Necessity*. Titled *Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language*, this work presents what Kripke himself calls a **“skeptical paradox”** about meaning and rule-following, and a corresponding “skeptical solution.” Although Kripke frames it as an interpretation of Wittgenstein, many suspect (and Kripke half-acknowledges) that it expresses Kripke’s own insights using Wittgenstein as a foil. Either way, the rule-following argument has forced philosophers of language to re-examine what it *means* to mean something.

The paradox is set up with a deceptively simple example: addition. Suppose a student has never computed numbers as large as 68 + 57 before. How do we know that by “+” she meant the addition function *plus* rather than some bizarre other function? Kripke invites us to imagine a strange scenario: a skeptic suggests that perhaps, in the student’s past usage, she actually meant a different rule, which Kripke labels *quus*. Defined artificially: *x ⊕ y = x + y* if *x, y < 57*, and *= 5* otherwise ([](https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2009-10/20229/LECTURES/11-kripkenstein.pdf#:~:text=Definition%20of%20quaddition%20x%20%E2%8A%95,is%20to%20ask%20yourself%3A%20yesterday)). This bizarre “quus” operation agrees with ordinary plus for all the sums the student has done before (all numbers less than 57). So the skeptic argues: how can we be sure that when she said “+” in the past, she wasn’t unconsciously following the *quus* rule? After all, all her past behavior is compatible with either interpretation—normal addition or this freakish quaddition. There seems to be **no fact about her past usage that determines** which she meant. Any amount of past behavior can be fit by infinitely many different rules. As Kripke’s Wittgenstein puts it, **“there is no fact about a speaker’s behavioral, mental or social life that can metaphysically determine, or constitute, what she means by her words”** ([Kripke’s Wittgenstein | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/kripkes-wittgenstein/#:~:text=later%20remarks%20on%20meaning%20and,Such%20a)) – at least not if we’re looking for a single person’s fact that rules out all the crazy interpretations. This is a startling claim: it suggests that meaning is *indeterminate* or underdetermined by any possible evidence or internal state. In Wittgenstein’s own vivid phrasing (which Kripke cites): **“This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule”** ([A Mathematical Interpretation of Wittgenstein's Rule Following ...](https://thephilosophyforum.com/discussion/12475/a-mathematical-interpretation-of-wittgensteins-rule-following-paradox#:~:text=A%20Mathematical%20Interpretation%20of%20Wittgenstein%27s,%E2%80%94%20Ludwig)). If every time I think I’m following a rule I might be *misinterpreting* it, then the entire idea of meaning something by a word begins to **“evaporate”** ([Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language* GEM Anscombe - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2380349#:~:text=Since%20the%20sceptic%20who%20supposes,%28)). Kripke’s skeptic concludes that there really is **“no fact about me that constitutes my having meant plus rather than quus”** in the past ([Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language* GEM Anscombe - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2380349#:~:text=Since%20the%20sceptic%20who%20supposes,%28)). Even my mental inclinations won’t help, because a clever enough interpretation could make those inclinations compatible with meaning something entirely different.

This is a radical skeptical challenge. It doesn’t just call into question how we *know* what someone means; it calls into question *what it is* for someone to mean anything at all. If nothing in my mind or behavior fixes what I meant by “plus,” then in some sense there *is no fact* as to what I meant. Kripke’s formulation: **“If there can be no fact about which particular function I meant in the past, there can be none in the present either”** ([Kripke’s Wittgenstein | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/kripkes-wittgenstein/#:~:text=The%20skeptic%E2%80%99s%20Constitution%20Demand%20asks,be%20none%20in%20the%20present)). Carried to its extreme, this leads to a kind of meaning nihilism: there’s no such thing as meaning plus or meaning anything by any word ([Kripke’s Wittgenstein | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/kripkes-wittgenstein/#:~:text=match%20at%20L907%20Having%20agreed,it%20seems%20that%20%E2%80%9CI%20apply)). That, of course, is an intolerable conclusion – **“not scepticism at all, it is conceptual nihilism”**, as one commentator put it ([Kripke’s Wittgenstein | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/kripkes-wittgenstein/#:~:text=Wittgenstein%E2%80%99s%20skeptic%2C%20however%2C%20there%20is,scepticism%2C%20it%20is%20manifestly%20self)). Wittgenstein (and Kripke) don’t want to say we have no meanings or that language is impossible; rather, the puzzle forces us to reassess *what we think meaning consists in*.

Kripke’s Wittgenstein proposes a **“skeptical solution.”** Unlike a straight solution, which would find some hidden fact to rebut the skeptic, the skeptical solution accepts that the skeptic is right that no internal fact (no mental state or Platonic relation) constitutes meaning. Instead, it reconceives what we do when we talk about meaning. In brief, Kripke argues that when we say *Jones means addition by “+”*, we aren’t reporting a private mental fact about Jones, but asserting something like: Jones has behaved (and will behave) in ways that accord with the addition table, and we as a community are *justified* in attributing to him the habit of addition. The focus shifts from truth-conditions to **assertability-conditions**: under what circumstances are we *licensed* to say someone is following a rule correctly or not? Kripke writes that **“our ordinary practice or belief is justified because – contrary appearances notwithstanding – it need not require the justification the sceptic has shown to be untenable.”** ([Kripke’s Wittgenstein | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/kripkes-wittgenstein/#:~:text=negative%20point%20of%20the%20skeptic%E2%80%99s,require%20the%20justification%20the%20sceptic)) In other words, we don’t need a metaphysical super-fact in the head to ground meaning; all we need is the shared, public criteria by which we judge each other to be using words correctly. Meaning becomes a kind of normative social practice. As Kripke’s Wittgenstein famously suggests, **“others will then have justification conditions for attributing correct or incorrect rule-following to the subject”** ([Kripke's Wittgenstein | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/kripkes-wittgenstein/#:~:text=Kripke%27s%20Wittgenstein%20,the%20subject%2C%20and%20these)), and those social justification conditions *are* all the notion of meaning can consist in.

This solution is “skeptical” because it doesn’t restore an objective fact-of-the-matter about meaning; it concedes that at bottom there’s just our practice. Yet it rescues meaning-talk from nihilism by showing that our practice doesn’t collapse—indeed, it is all we’ve ever needed. We still can say Jones means plus by “+” as long as Jones’s usage coheres with the community’s arithmetic practices, and there’s no issue of some occult fact beyond that. Many philosophers have debated whether this is a *correct* reading of Wittgenstein or a persuasive theory in itself. Kripke himself notes that this sort of solution is akin to Hume’s solution to his skeptical problem of induction: Hume “solved” the problem of justifying induction by saying, in effect, we’re psychologically disposed to inductive reasoning and we’d be sunk without it, so we carry on. Similarly, Kripke’s Wittgenstein suggests we philosophically reconstrue “meaning” as just a reflection of our social linguistic behavior, not a mysterious correspondence between words and private Platonic meanings. 

Whether or not one accepts the skeptical solution, Kripke’s articulation of the **rule-following paradox** has had enormous influence. It highlighted the inherently **normative** character of meaning: following a rule isn’t just about what *will* happen, but about what *ought* to happen – what counts as *correct* or *mistaken*. If no fact in an individual can determine this normativity, then it must be found in communal standards or practices. This line of thought gave rise to whole literatures on the “normativity of meaning” and on “communitarian” versus individualist theories of mind and language ([The Normativity of Meaning and Content](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning-normativity/#:~:text=The%20Normativity%20of%20Meaning%20and,following)). Kripke’s little book thus reframed Wittgenstein’s legacy for a new generation, spawning interpretations and counter-arguments (from philosophers like Simon Blackburn, Crispin Wright, and John McDowell, among others). Importantly, as John Burgess notes, Kripke in *Wittgenstein on Rules…* was not primarily interested in historical exegesis of Wittgenstein; he was using the *Investigations* to advance a live philosophical problem about how language and thought get their content ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=to%20work%20in%20philosophy%20proper,Moreover%2C%20his)). Kripke himself later said that whether or not his interpretation captured Wittgenstein, the skeptical paradox *stands on its own* as a challenge. And indeed, any adequate theory of meaning now must answer to something like Kripke’s challenge: *What fact could constitute meaning, beyond all future interpretations?* If the answer is “no such fact,” we then must make sense of meaning in other terms. In typical Kripkean fashion, he had taken an old philosophical puzzle and given it startling new life, using plain language and simple examples (like a child’s arithmetic) to expose a genuine abyss beneath our everyday certainties.

## Puzzles of Belief and Identity in Language

Kripke’s penchant for puzzles extends beyond rule-following. In a celebrated 1979 article titled “A Puzzle About Belief” (now collected in *Philosophical Troubles*), he tackled a problem about **belief ascriptions** – how we talk about what someone believes – that shakes up assumptions in the philosophy of language and mind. This puzzle is closely related to issues first noted by Frege (the difference between *sense* and *reference* in contexts like “believes that...”), but Kripke presents it in a dramatic story form and drives it to a perplexing conclusion that resists easy solution.

The tale is of a man named **Pierre**, a monolingual French speaker who grows up hearing wonderful things about a distant city called *“Londres.”* Pierre learns and sincerely believes the French sentence *“Londres est jolie”* (London is pretty) – forming the belief that London (Londres) is a beautiful city. Later, Pierre moves to an English-speaking city, which happens to be London, but he doesn’t know that *“London”* in English is the same place that Francophones call *Londres*. His new surroundings in London are ugly and disappointing to him. So in English he comes to believe that *“London is not pretty.”* As Burgess retells: **“Pierre as a child saw pretty pictures of a city the Francophones around him called ‘Londres,’ and as an adult had to spend time in ugly surroundings in a city the Anglophones called ‘London.’ Speaking English, he says… ‘London is not pretty.’ Speaking French, he says… ‘Londres est jolie.’”** ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=bilinguals,is%20not%20pretty%2C%E2%80%99%20or%20simply)) Kripke then asks us: **“Does Pierre believe that London is pretty?”** This seemingly simple question now yields a paradox. If we go by Pierre’s English statements, by direct “disquotation” we’d answer: *No*, Pierre believes London is *not* pretty ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=%E2%80%98London%20is%20not%20pretty,we%20would%20infer%20that%20he)). But if we translate Pierre’s French belief (since “Londres” just is London) and disquote, we’d answer: *Yes*, Pierre believes London *is* pretty ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=%E2%80%98London%20is%20not%20pretty,we%20would%20infer%20that%20he)). We have equally strong reasons to say Pierre *does* and *does not* believe that London is pretty ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=%E2%80%98London%20is%20not%20pretty,we%20would%20infer%20that%20he)). 

We might be tempted to say Pierre is simply confused or has contradictory beliefs. But we can imagine the scenario such that Pierre is perfectly rational and has no occasion to put together that *Londres = London*. From his perspective, there is no contradiction – he’s talking about what he thinks are two different cities. Yet from the outside omniscient perspective, we see it’s the same city. How should we report his belief state? Kripke shows that any answer is problematic. If we say “Pierre believes London is pretty” (translating his French state of mind), we seem to attribute to him a belief that, in English, he would firmly deny holding. If we say “Pierre does not believe London is pretty,” we seem to mis-report his Francophone attitude. Even granting the principle that *Londres = London*, it seems we cannot substitute co-referential names in belief contexts without potential failure of truth – a direct violation of the normally assumed principle that substituting identicals should preserve truth. Kripke has thus staged a direct collision between two intuitively plausible principles: (1) that you can translate someone’s belief from one language to another without loss of content (since *“Londres est jolie”* means that London is pretty), and (2) that belief reports in our language should square with what the person would sincerely avow in that language. In Pierre’s case, these principles conflict ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=%E2%80%98London%20is%20not%20pretty,we%20would%20infer%20that%20he)). 

“A Puzzle About Belief” generalizes this into a dilemma for any theory of belief ascriptions. A straightforward **Millian** view (where a proper name contributes only its referent to propositions) would say Pierre has one belief with the content <London, is pretty> and also the belief <London, is not pretty> – a plain contradiction. But Pierre isn’t irrational or contradicting himself knowingly; the contradiction arises only from our outside translation. A more **Fregean** view would say Pierre associates different senses with “Londres” and “London,” so he in effect has two different beliefs that aren’t outright contradictory. That might save Pierre from irrationality, but then what is the truth-value of “Pierre believes London is pretty”? Is it true or false? On a strict Fregean view, perhaps the name “London” in our report must match the mode of presentation Pierre has in mind. But Pierre has two different ways of thinking of the city, so which do we pick? Any choice seems arbitrary, and saying the sentence is simply ambiguous or neither true nor false is very unsatisfying for a declarative report. Kripke carefully explores and rejects a variety of potential solutions (such as treating names as ambiguous, or introducing metalinguistic beliefs about words). The puzzle is that **even a perfect user of two languages can be in a state that defies our usual logical rules for substituting co-referential terms in belief reports** ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=believe%20that%20London%20is%20pretty%3F%E2%80%99,we%20would%20infer%20that%20he)) ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=match%20at%20L3520%20common%20with,a%20response%20of%20my%20own)). It “points to a fundamental problem about reporting in our own language a belief held by a subject in a different language or idiolect,” Kripke writes ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=Puzzling%20Pierre%20The%20avowed%20primary,Or%20rather%2C%20the)) ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=%E2%80%98London%20is%20not%20pretty,we%20would%20infer%20that%20he)). The problem isn’t just Pierre; it potentially affects any case of **“indirect quotation”** or translation of belief – an issue already recognized by Quine and others, but Kripke sharpens it to a fine point.

Notably, Kripke does **not** offer a grand solution to the Pierre puzzle. In fact, he suggests that any theory of belief – Millian, Fregean, or otherwise – will have some counterintuitive consequence, and we may have to simply live with some friction. His own inclination is to *deny* that the translation principle is straightforward: perhaps *“Pierre believes that London is pretty”* in English is just **not** a legitimate report of his state, even though *“Pierre croit que Londres est jolie”* is true in French ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=Pierre%20believe%20that%20London%20is,about%20reporting%20in%20our%20own)). This is a kind of **contextualist** move: the content of a belief ascription might depend on the language and concepts in play. Alternatively, one might bite the bullet and say Pierre indeed has inconsistent beliefs (many philosophers since have considered that a person can have compartmentalized contradictory beliefs without realizing it). Kripke does mention one formally possible move – that names like “London” in belief context somehow refer not to the city but to the idea of the city under a certain name (a metalinguistic interpretation) – but he finds it unpersuasive ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=match%20at%20L3520%20common%20with,a%20response%20of%20my%20own)). In the end, Kripke leaves the puzzle as *a puzzle*, remarking that it “illustrates the difficulty” in principles we might otherwise take for granted, and he challenges the reader to think what *belief* really involves if such scenarios are possible ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=believe%20that%20London%20is%20pretty%3F%E2%80%99,we%20would%20infer%20that%20he)) ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=match%20at%20L3520%20common%20with,a%20response%20of%20my%20own)).

This puzzle had a notable impact because it showed that even if we accept Kripke’s own earlier arguments that names are rigid designators with no descriptive sense, we still face serious problems when those names occur in propositional attitude contexts like belief reports. It forces a refinement: perhaps the semantic reference of “London” is fixed, but the **cognitive significance** of that name for the subject cannot be ignored in contexts of belief and knowledge. Kripke’s work thus in some ways reignited interest in Frege’s notion of *Sinn* (sense), not to rescue descriptivism, but to handle the puzzles of informative identities and belief contexts. Indeed, in later published lectures (*Philosophical Troubles*), Kripke went on to examine Frege’s and Russell’s theories directly (“Frege’s Theory of Sense and Reference” and “Russell’s Notion of Scope”), clarifying where those pioneers went wrong and right. But even as he clarified, Kripke didn’t minimize the depth of the problem: he gave it new, concrete form in Pierre’s story. As the Burgess commentary notes, **“the difficulty in answering the question [Does Pierre believe London is pretty?] (attested by the diversity of answers defended in the ensuing literature) points to a fundamental problem”** ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=believe%20that%20London%20is%20pretty%3F%E2%80%99,we%20would%20infer%20that%20he)). In classic Kripkean style, he managed to show that something as ordinary as *believing a city is pretty* can hide a logical tangle, one that forces us to refine our theories of language and mind.

## Semantics of Truth and the Liar Paradox

Another major strand of Kripke’s work, less popularly known but highly regarded in logical circles, is his contribution to the **theory of truth**. In his 1975 paper “Outline of a Theory of Truth,” Kripke tackled the ancient **Liar Paradox** (“This sentence is false”) with the tools of modern semantic theory. Tarski had famously shown that no language can consistently contain its own truth predicate (by constructing a liar sentence that says “I am not true”). Tarski’s solution was to use a hierarchy of languages: a sentence can only be true or false in a *meta-language* higher than the language it talks about. Kripke’s approach was more flexible and, in a sense, more *semantic* than Tarski’s syntactic hierarchy. He asked: can we define truth for a language that can talk about its own sentences, if we’re willing to allow that some sentences might be neither true nor false?

Kripke’s theory defines a formal language with a truth predicate **“True(·)”** that can apply to sentences of the same language. The key idea is to define truth as the **minimal fixed point** of some semantic conditions. We start by taking all “grounded” sentences (those that don’t lead to paradox) and evaluating them in the ordinary way, leaving the paradoxical ones without a truth value for now. Then we see which sentences would be true if those currently without truth value stayed without one, and which would be false, and we keep expanding this assignment until it “reaches a fixed point” where no further changes occur. The result is that every sentence is assigned either true, false, or in some cases neither (undefined). The liar sentence L (“L is not true”) in such a model ends up in the third category: it is **ungrounded** – it has no truth value at the fixed point. Kripke then suggests calling such sentences *“paradoxical”*: **“a sentence is paradoxical if it has no truth value in any fixed point”** ([[PDF] Outline of a Theory of Truth Saul Kripke The Journal of Philosophy ...](https://www.impan.pl/~kz/truthseminar/Kripke_Outline.pdf#:~:text=This%20suggests%20the%20following%20definition%3A,That%20is%2C%20a%20paradoxical)). Indeed L has no truth value in *any* consistent assignment, so it is “paradoxical” in that sense ([[PDF] Outline of a Theory of Truth Saul Kripke The Journal of Philosophy ...](https://www.impan.pl/~kz/truthseminar/Kripke_Outline.pdf#:~:text=This%20suggests%20the%20following%20definition%3A,That%20is%2C%20a%20paradoxical)). But this is not a bug, it’s a feature: we *want* L to be neither true nor false, to avoid contradiction. And Kripke’s construction guarantees that every non-paradoxical sentence gets a proper truth value in the minimal fixed point (the least assignment of truth values that satisfies the logical constraints).

In simpler terms, Kripke’s theory allows truth to be a **partial** predicate. The law of excluded middle (“every sentence is true or false”) is sacrificed for sentences that refer to their own truth. By doing so, we escape triviality. Kripke showed in detail how to construct the least fixed point and proved it was unique. In that minimal fixed point, liar-like sentences are exactly those left without a truth value. For example, the liar L does not come out true (because that would make it false) nor false (because that would make it true); it just remains ungrounded – not true, and not false. This approach was startling because it sidestepped Tarski’s hierarchy and treated truth as a **property that some sentences *lack***, rather than a property that leads to contradiction if universally applied. The theory preserves the equivalence schema (“`‘φ’ is true` if and only if φ”), except it fails for paradoxical φ since neither “φ is true” nor φ gets a truth value in those cases. This is a **“Kripke fixed-point”** theory of truth, now a standard part of logical semantics. In fact, the notion of **“grounded”** and **“ungrounded”** statements originates here: a grounded statement’s truth can be eventually determined by a finite chain of reference to non-semantic facts, whereas an ungrounded one like L loops through semantics in a way that never settles.

What’s remarkable is how Kripke’s style shines through even in this technical work. He manages to explain the construction in an intuitive way, using the image of successive approximation: start by assuming all liar-like sentences are neither true nor false, see which sentences become evaluable, assign them truth values, then go back and fill in more, etc. Eventually the process “settles down” to a fixed point. He quips that even though we avoid an infinite hierarchy of languages, **“the ghost of the Tarskian hierarchy is still present”** in the successive stages of approximation ([[PDF] Kripke's Wittgenstein and Semantic Factualism](https://jhaponline.org/jhap/article/view/4370/3849#:~:text=skeptical%20solution,point%20out%20is%20the)) ([Facts, Truth Conditions, and the Skeptical Solution to the Rule ... - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2676152#:~:text=jstor%20www,the%20skeptical%20solution%20he%20is)). Indeed, higher and higher approximations act like Tarski’s higher languages, but crucially, one can take the *limit* of that process inside a single language. Kripke’s was the first elegant **model-theoretic solution** to the liar paradox in a classical logic setting, and it spawned a cottage industry of further work (Visser, Feferman, and others have built on it, and alternative approaches like *revision theory* were developed in response). The concept of a truth predicate that is *partial* but still obeys Tarski’s T-schema for grounded sentences is now well-established. In the history of ideas about truth, you have Tarski’s hierarchical theory (1930s), Kripke’s fixed-point theory (1975), and later Gupta and Belnap’s revision theory (1980s) as major landmarks. Kripke’s stands out for its combination of simplicity and mathematical rigor. It exemplifies his knack for finding just the right formal tweak to dissolve a paradox without destroying our intuitions. The liar paradox, which once seemed to demand an infinite hierarchy or a dramatic change in logic, can be domesticated by a natural partial valuation method. 

Kripke himself was somewhat modest about this achievement – the 1975 paper is brief and matter-of-fact, almost an “outline” as its title says. But its influence in logic and formal semantics has been profound. Interestingly, Kripke never lost sight of the intuitive philosophical motivation: to let us talk about truth within our own language in a coherent way. By allowing truth to be a *predicate* of our own sentences (something Tarski said was impossible without contradiction), Kripke enabled a kind of unified perspective on language. We can now see where the *paradoxicality* lies: a liar sentence is one that tries to assert something about itself that it can never consistently have. In the fixed point, it remains in a limbo – the theory **“does not assign it a truth value (either truth or falsity)”** ([[PDF] Outline of a Theory of Truth Saul Kripke The Journal of Philosophy ...](https://www.impan.pl/~kz/truthseminar/Kripke_Outline.pdf#:~:text=This%20suggests%20the%20following%20definition%3A,That%20is%2C%20a%20paradoxical)). And that is the final diagnosis: the liar sentence is pathological, not meaningful in the way normal sentences are. 

This resonates with a theme in Kripke’s later writing: that not all our intuitive notions can be made perfectly precise, but we can often segregate the well-behaved part from the ill-behaved. In the case of truth, we keep the intuitive notion for the grounded part of language and isolate the pathology (liar-like self-reference) as a special case. This attitude is also visible in his treatment of the rule-following paradox: we keep our ordinary practice of meaning and rule-use, while recognizing that the philosophical demand for a certain kind of *fact* was misguided. It’s a pattern of **preserving what works and demystifying what doesn’t**.

## Conclusion: Kripke’s Voice and Legacy

Spanning from modal logic to the mysteries of mind, from the semantics of names to the paradoxes of self-reference, Saul Kripke’s published work covers an astonishing range of themes. Yet there is a unifying quality to Kripke’s philosophical voice. Readers often remark on how *personal* and *conversational* his writing feels. His major works were largely transcripts of spoken lectures, and they retain the freshness of a mind thinking problems through in real time—pressing a point, anticipating objections with humor, indulging in an occasional anecdote or aside. The *New Yorker*-style profile of Kripke would surely note his eccentric charm (the man who, as a boy genius in Omaha, *“would have invented algebra if it hadn’t already been invented”* ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=at%20the%20Conservative%20Beth%20El,of%20perceptions%2C%20bundle%20of%20perceptions%E2%80%9D)), and whose unassuming manner belied a fierce intellect). But more importantly, Kripke’s profile emerges from his ideas: a philosopher who relished **“puzzles”** and **“mysteries”**, who had the patience to stay with a paradox and the clarity to unravel it slowly. As his colleague John Burgess observed, Kripke spent his career grappling with **“mysteries surrounding the nature of necessity, rule-following, and the conscious mind, as well as intricate and intriguing puzzles about identity, belief and self-reference.”** ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=has%20been%20anything%20but%20a,of%20the%20philosopher%E2%80%99s%20major%20publications)) Few thinkers could engage such a disparate set of problems and leave each forever changed. Naming and necessity, reference and existence, truth and meaning—all these received from Kripke not a system or doctrine, but a series of deeply original insights, often conveyed with plainspoken examples that lodge in the reader’s mind. 

Kripke’s influence on analytic philosophy is incalculable. With *Naming and Necessity*, he **“reversed the pattern of two centuries of philosophizing about the necessary and the contingent”** ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=Saul%20Kripke%20has%20been%20a,awaited%20collection%C2%A0Philosophical%20Troubles)), rehabilitating essentialism and de-re modality in an era that had cast them aside. In doing so he gave philosophers a new toolkit: rigid designation, possible world semantics used judiciously, the separation of epistemology from metaphysics. The vocabulary of “a posteriori necessity” and “essential properties” became common currency thanks to him. In philosophy of language, his critique of descriptivism and his causal theory of names fundamentally reshaped discussions of reference—drawing praise, refinement, and sometimes resistance (some defended descriptive insights or proposed hybrid theories, but they had to contend with Kripke’s arguments). In metaphysics, talk of transworld identity and origin essentialism took on new life. In epistemology and mind, Kripke’s modal argument challenged materialists to either rebut the apparent conceivability of pain without brain states or else question the Kripkean link between conceivability and possibility. In logic and formal semantics, the Kripke fixed-point construction for truth opened new paths in the study of self-referential languages. And in the interpretation of Wittgenstein, “Kripkenstein” forced anyone writing on rule-following to address the skeptic’s cry: *“Meaning cannot be a mere fact!”* All this from someone who published relatively sparingly. Indeed, for many years *Naming and Necessity* and a handful of articles were all that was publicly available, while a kind of mystique grew around recordings and unpublished manuscripts. (In recent years, the *Philosophical Troubles* collections and other edited transcripts have started to bring more of “Kripkeana” to light ([Kripke [PDF] [1rmpuf4ib82o]](https://vdoc.pub/documents/kripke-1rmpuf4ib82o#:~:text=and%20allied%20fields%2C%20despite%20the,The)).) 

Beyond the content of his ideas, Kripke’s *style* and methodology also left a mark. He exemplified how to do rigorous philosophy with a minimum of jargon and a maximum of insight. As the Guardian obituary noted, he was *“unpompous, clear and direct”* in both speech and writing ([Saul Kripke obituary | Philosophy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/saul-kripke-obituary#:~:text=Kripke%20was%20notorious%20for%20his,was%20unpompous%2C%20clear%20and%20direct)). He did not build grand systems or parade formal derivations (even though he could have, being a first-rate logician); instead, he disarmed the reader with frank commonsense observations that opened into startling philosophical consequences. Who else would begin a revolution in semantics by musing on whether Aristotle might have taught philosophy *or* gone into politics? Or unravel the nature of belief using a fictional Frenchman with a hometown pride problem? Or explain the essence of pain by asking you to imagine that very pain you felt last night existing without being a pain? These are almost storybook approaches, yet they carry the weight of rigorous argument underneath. Kripke had a gift for the **telling example** – the thought experiment or anecdote that changes how you think about a concept forever (Gödel vs Schmidt, Nixon named “Throat”, the plus/quus pupil, Pierre and London, etc., have all entered philosophy’s lore). 

At the same time, Kripke was deeply conversant with the analytic tradition and often paid homage to it even as he redirected it. He engages with Frege and Russell continually, sometimes critically but with respect for what their frameworks achieved. In *Naming and Necessity* he credits Frege’s distinction between sense and reference even while ultimately rejecting that senses (descriptions) fix reference in the way Frege thought ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=names%20are%20always%20rigid%20designators,and%20may%02be%20%27no%20one%20did)). In the rule-following book, he professes great admiration for Wittgenstein, calling the skeptic’s argument *“Wittgenstein’s paradox”* (though not all agree Wittgenstein intended it that way). Kripke’s work is thus a conversation with the giants of philosophy – but a conversation on his own terms, with his own distinctive lexicon and charm. 

It is perhaps fitting to give Kripke the last word in this survey of his thought. In the preface to *Naming and Necessity*, reflecting on the sometimes surprising turns his arguments took, Kripke remarked that philosophical progress often comes not by straightforward linear argument but by freeing ourselves from picture assumptions and following through on new ideas despite skepticism ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=cases%2C%20the%20treatment%20of%20disputed,within%20the%20bounds%20of%20this)) ([](https://neuroself.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/naming-and-necessity-full-text.pdf#:~:text=further%20clarification%20of%20certain%20points%2C,I%20leave%20it%20to%20the)). The result, in his case, was a set of new “pictures” – of language as a chain, of necessity as rooted in the world’s essence, of meaning as use within a community – that now inform how philosophers see these issues. Kripke once described his own approach with characteristic simplicity: *“I’m just trying to get things right, to get clear on how things really are.”* He had the courage to trust clear reasoning over fashionable consensus, and to let ordinary language guide technical insight. By “getting things right” in one domain after another, Saul Kripke earned his place as, in the words of one memorial tribute, **“one of analytic philosophy’s greatest ever minds.”** And he did so in a way that future philosophers, reading him, still feel they are in the presence of a uniquely **alive** intellect – a mind at play, delighting in the sheer *wonder* of philosophical problems even as it untangles them. Through his works, we too are invited to trace the links in the chain of reference, to imagine other possible worlds, to doubt and then restore our notions of meaning and truth – in short, to do philosophy with the combination of rigor and imagination that Kripke exemplified.
