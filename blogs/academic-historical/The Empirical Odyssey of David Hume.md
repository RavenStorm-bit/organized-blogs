# The Empirical Odyssey of David Hume: An Intellectual Journey

David Hume’s philosophical career unfolds as a grand journey through human nature, charted in the pages of his works from **1739** to **1779**. With a clear-eyed empiricism and a penchant for skeptical questioning, Hume walked his readers through the mind’s faculties, the stirrings of passion, the roots of morality, the nature of religion, and even the sweep of history. In what follows, we travel book by book – in the order they appeared – closely reading Hume’s major works. We let Hume speak for himself through extensive quotation, tracing recurring themes of experience and doubt, cause and effect, selfhood, morality, religion, and politics. The tone is at once analytical and narrative, aiming to feel the texture of Hume’s mind in action. Each step of the way, Hume’s own arguments and prose guide us, without modern filter or comparison, as we watch a great empiricist philosopher develop his thought across a lifetime of writing.

## *A Treatise of Human Nature* (1739–1740)

Hume burst onto the philosophical scene at age 28 with the *Treatise of Human Nature*, ambitiously subtitled “*Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into MORAL SUBJECTS*.” The work was published anonymously in three books between 1739 and 1740. It is Hume’s fullest and boldest systematic philosophy – a sprawling investigation of understanding, passions, and morals grounded in experience. In the introduction, Hume announces that instead of praising his system by denigrating previous thinkers, he will candidly admit “the present imperfect condition of the sciences” and try a new approach ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=N%20OTHING%20is%20more%20usual,Principles%20taken%20upon%20trust%2C%20consequences)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=Nor%20is%20there%20requir%27d%20such,and%20no%20man%20needs%20ever)). He proposes to apply the empiricism of scientists like Newton to the human mind itself. As Hume puts it in Book I, he is examining “the **foundation of morals, reasoning, and criticism**” by proceeding from particular observations to general principles ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=The%20other%20species%20of%20philosophers,While%20they%20attempt%20this%20arduous)). This “accurate and abstruse” philosophy – difficult, yet aiming at truth – he contrasts with the “easy and obvious” philosophy that paints virtue in pleasing colors for popular consumption ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=M%20ORAL%20philosophy%2C%20or%20the,fitted%20to%20please%20the%20imagination)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=The%20other%20species%20of%20philosophers,While%20they%20attempt%20this%20arduous)). Hume opts for the difficult route, seeking nothing less than a complete “chain of reasoning” about human nature ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=M%20Y%20design%20in%20the,of%20the%20public%20I%20consider)).

### Impressions, Ideas, and Empiricism

In Book I, *Of the Understanding*, Hume builds his philosophy from the ground up. He starts by sorting all the mind’s perceptions into two basic kinds: **impressions** (the lively original experiences of sensing and feeling) and **ideas** (the fainter copies we reflect upon in thought). “All the perceptions of the mind are of two kinds,” Hume writes, “**viz. impressions and ideas, which differ from each other only in their different degrees of force and vivacity**. **Our ideas are copied from our impressions, and represent them in all their parts**” ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=All%20the%20perceptions%20of%20the,of%20a%20particular%20object%2C%20you)). With this simple empirical axiom – that there are no ideas without antecedent impressions – Hume wields a powerful tool to scrutinize our concepts. If someone professes a lofty idea (say, of a metaphysical self or a divine power), Hume pointedly asks: from what impression does that idea derive? If none can be found, the idea may be illusory. As he bluntly states regarding the idea of a persistent self: “For from what impression cou’d this idea be deriv’d? … **If any impression gives rise to the idea of self, that impression must continue invariably the same… But there is no impression constant and invariable.** Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other… **therefore, there is no such idea**” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/1/4/6#:~:text=Unluckily%20all%20these%20positive%20assertions,the%20idea%20of%20self%2C%20that)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/1/4/6#:~:text=lives%3B%20since%20self%20is%20suppos%27d,there%20is%20no%20such%20idea)). Hume’s empiricism is thus an acid test: our thought’s most cherished notions must be traced to experience or discarded as “sophistry and illusion,” a theme he would hammer home throughout his works.

Hume’s empirical method leads him to some famously radical conclusions in Book I. Examining how we reason about matters of fact, he locates the principle of **cause and effect** as the cornerstone of our inferences. We never actually perceive causation in the abstract; we perceive only one event following another. How then do we come by the idea of necessary connection between cause and effect? Hume’s answer is that it is a habit of mind – **custom** – that produces the feeling of necessity. When we repeatedly observe A followed by B, our imagination grows accustomed to this sequence, and we come to expect B whenever A occurs. “We are determined by custom to transfer the past to the future,” he explains, and to suppose a similar connection will persist ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=E%201.3%2C%20SBN%206)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=man%20chiefly%20as%20born%20for,in%20a%20proper%20contrast%3B%20and)). But this expectation is a psychological fact, not a logical insight. In a bravura analysis, Hume argues that **pure reason cannot justify causal inference**: we can never *demonstrate* that the future must resemble the past, nor that every effect has a determinate cause – we only assume so because of habit. Moreover, when we probe what we *mean* by saying “X causes Y,” all we can point to is the constant conjunction of X and Y and the mind’s anticipation of Y upon X. There is no *observable* necessary power binding them beyond that regularity. Thus, Hume concludes we have **no rational warrant for our causal beliefs** – a stunningly skeptical finding that would later be known as “Hume’s problem of induction.” In the *Treatise*, stated in his characteristically clear prose, it reads: “When we look about us towards external objects, and consider the operation of causes, we are never able… to discover any power or necessary connexion…  ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=truth%20and%20falsehood%2C%20vice%20and,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)). **We only find, that the one does actually, in fact, follow the other**” (a formulation he refines in the later *Enquiry*).

Hume doesn’t shy away from the unsettling implications of this empiricism. In *Treatise* Book I he also tackles the idea of the self and personal identity, applying his “no impression, no idea” rule to our notion of a persistent self. The result is Hume’s famous **bundle theory of the self**. We like to suppose we are a single, continuous identity; but when Hume introspects, he finds no impression of a simple, enduring “I.” He finds only particular perceptions – this thought, that sensation – flitting by. “**For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself,**” Hume observes in a remarkable passage, “**I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception**” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/1/4/6#:~:text=do%20they%20belong%20to%20self%3B,nor%20do%20I%20conceive%20what)). If our idea of self isn’t based on an impression (since there is none constant), it can’t be a proper idea at all. What we call the self is merely a bundle or collection of perceptions, tied together by the relations of resemblance and causation (memory links our past impressions, etc.), but **no single “self” is ever perceived**. “I may venture to affirm… of the rest of mankind, **that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions**, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity,” Hume writes, exploding the notion of an indivisible soul ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/1/4/6#:~:text=But%20setting%20aside%20some%20metaphysicians,other%20with%20an%20inconceivable%20rapidity)). The *Treatise* thus pushes empiricism to its limits, casting doubt on deep philosophical ideas – substance, soul, causality, even external reality – by showing our experience gives us no secure grip on them. Hume’s skeptical bent is on full display, even as he systematically constructs a theory of how the mind actually operates.

### The Passions and the Mastery of “Reason”

Book II of the *Treatise*, *Of the Passions*, shifts from abstract ideas to human emotions and motivations. Here Hume develops a naturalistic psychology of the sentiments, one that will undergird his moral theory. A crucial theme emerges: **reason alone is impotent to produce or resist passion**. Hume famously declares that **reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions** – a startling rebuke to rationalist ethics. In Hume’s view, our desires and feelings ultimately drive action; reason’s role is merely to inform us of facts or means to satisfy those passions, not to set our ends. He articulates this in uncompromising terms: *“We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. **Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them**”* ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=our%20passion%2C%20cannot%20be%20the,it%20by%20some%20other%20considerations)). Any seeming conflict between reason and passion, Hume argues, arises only when a passion is built on a false belief (in which case *reason* can correct the *belief*, but not the passion’s force itself), or when we choose improper means to our ends (where *reason* advises more effective means) ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=What%20may%20at%20first%20occur,action%2C%20we%20chuse%20means%20insufficient)) ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=condemn%20it,judgment%20in%20order%20to%20its)). But no passion, as a mere feeling, can be “contrary to reason,” since reason judges truth and falsehood, not what we should desire ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=effects,the%20greatest%20and%20most%20valuable)). This provocative stance – that **emotions cannot be unreasonable in themselves** – flips centuries of philosophical wisdom on its head, subordinating reason to sentiment in the conduct of life. Hume illustrates the point with almost shocking examples: *“‘Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger… It is as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledged lesser good to my greater”* ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=condemn%20it,In)). Such choices may be *foolish* or *vicious*, but calling them *unreasonable* mistakes the proper domain of reason. By demoting reason’s authority, Hume elevates the understanding of human nature as driven fundamentally by feelings – a theme that will reappear in his moral philosophy.

Hume’s taxonomy of the passions is detailed and rich. He analyzes pride and humility, love and hatred, the will and direct passions (like desire, aversion, hope, fear) with the same empirical approach he applied to cognition. For example, he explores how pride is typically caused by something related to oneself that is pleasurable, and how sympathy (or what we’d call empathy) allows the passions to transmit between people. Notably, *Treatise* Book II presents Hume’s initial foray into the question of **free will** versus **determinism** (the classic “liberty and necessity” debate). Hume argues for a **compatibilist** position: our actions are indeed determined by causes (our motives, character, circumstances), but we are nonetheless free as long as we act according to our will without external constraint. In everyday life, we all understand that consistent *character* makes human behavior predictable, “as regular and certain as the operations of nature” ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=it%20can%20withstand%20any%20principle%2C,it%20by%20some%20other%20considerations)) ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=The%20consequences%20are%20evident,I%20may%20desire)). This predictable connection of motives to actions is what we *mean* by necessity in the human realm, and without it, moral responsibility would collapse (since we couldn’t blame or praise unpredictable, haphazard actions). Freedom, properly understood, is just the power to act according to the determinations of our will – which is entirely compatible with those determinations having causes. This reconciliation of necessity with liberty, presented here in youthful form, remains a hallmark of Hume’s philosophy (he would restate it more succinctly in the *Enquiry on Human Understanding*). The upshot in Book II is that human behavior, no less than human understanding, follows regular laws – albeit psychological ones – that observation can uncover. **Experience and observation**, Hume insists, are our true guides to how passions operate; any notion of a soul outside the causal order or a reason aloof from sentiment is illusory. 

### Morals, Virtue, and “Artificial” Justice

In Book III, *Of Morals*, Hume applies his empiricism to ethical questions, laying the groundwork for what would become his mature moral philosophy. He opens by confronting a rationalist view head-on: can moral distinctions (good and evil, virtue and vice) be discovered by reason alone? Hume’s answer is an emphatic no – moral evaluation ultimately depends on sentiment. **Reason can inform us of facts, but it cannot declare that some state of affairs is *to-be-pursued* or *avoided* unless some desire or feeling enters the equation.** This argument famously includes Hume’s logical point that you cannot derive an “ought” from an “is” without adding some desire or sentiment into the premise. In the *Treatise* he puts it thus: Though it is popular to say virtue is following reason, in fact “morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. **The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason**” (this is the germ of what later came to be called the “is–ought” problem). Instead, moral judgments spring from an *inner sense* or feeling of approval (esteem, praise) or disapproval (blame) that arises in spectators of an action or character. Hume identifies this feeling with **sympathy** and a shared human nature that responds with pleasure to what is useful or agreeable to society or to the person, and with displeasure to the harmful or ugly. Thus virtue, Hume argues, is defined by the approval sentiment: *“no action can be virtuous or morally good, unless there be in human nature some motive to produce it distinct from the sense of its morality”* – otherwise calling it “virtuous” would be meaningless flattery ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=What%20may%20at%20first%20occur,action%2C%20we%20chuse%20means%20insufficient)) ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=The%20consequences%20are%20evident,I%20may%20desire)). In short, we don’t call something virtuous because it’s rational; we call it virtuous because by our nature we *like* the effects of it (courage, charity, etc.), and we call something vicious because we *dislike* its effects (cruelty, treachery, etc.). Hume roots ethics in human feelings and the **social utility** of traits, a perspective he will refine in his later *Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals*. 

One of the most striking discussions in Book III is Hume’s account of **justice** as an “artificial virtue.” He notes that unlike natural virtues (like benevolence or generosity, which directly please by their inherent tendencies), justice – meaning roughly respect for property, promise-keeping, adherence to general rules – is not an instinctive sentiment but a societal construction that we cultivate because of its necessity. In humanity’s original condition, extreme abundance or extreme scarcity would render the concept of justice irrelevant (if everything is super-abundant, there’s no need to worry about mine and thine; if everything is desperately scarce or people are wholly malicious, communal rules won’t hold) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=UTILITY%2C%20which%20results%20to%20the,malice%3A%20By%20rendering%20justice%20totally)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=The%20dilemma%20seems%20obvious%3A%20As,offspring%2C%20and%20other%20passions%2C%20arises)). But in the **moderate circumstance of limited benevolence and moderate scarcity** – the actual condition of humans – establishing conventions of property, trade, and promise gives immense advantage. Justice, Hume argues, arises when people recognize it is mutually beneficial to play by the same rules. Importantly, **the moral merit of justice comes entirely from its social usefulness**. “**That public utility is the sole origin of justice, and that reflections on the beneficial consequences of this virtue are the sole foundation of its merit**,” Hume boldly asserts, “will better deserve our examination” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=T%20HAT%20Justice%20is%20useful,this%20virtue%20are%20the%20sole)). He proceeds to show that every rule of justice (respecting property, fidelity to promises, fair transfer by consent, etc.) is explicable by the *interest of society* in peace and order ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=If%20we%20examine%20the%20particular,society%2C%20that%20men%27s%20possessions%20should)). No abstract reasoning or innate moral intuition alone could generate the obligation to keep a promise – it’s the observed *usefulness* of a system of promise-keeping that leads us to approve and inculcate this duty. Hume even imagines scenarios (a shipwreck, an invasion by absolute barbarians) where the normal rules of justice would suspend because their utility – the very justification for them – disappears ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=equity%20and%20justice%2C%20are%20rules,no%20longer%20serve%20to%20any)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=The%20dilemma%20seems%20obvious%3A%20As,offspring%2C%20and%20other%20passions%2C%20arises)). In such cases we wouldn’t call it “virtue” to adhere to property rights that no longer serve the common good. This thoroughly secular, pragmatic understanding of justice was revolutionary: virtue is not etched by God into the universe, but grows from human conventions that solve practical problems. To Hume, the **moral sentiment** of approval for justice is cultivated in us *because* we are taught to appreciate its necessity for society. It’s “artificial” not in the sense of fake, but in the sense of constructed by human artifice (as opposed to flowing directly from our natural sentiments like maternal care or friendship do). 

Throughout the *Treatise*, Hume’s prose is clear, candid, and often tinged with irony. He doesn’t hesitate to illustrate abstract points with homely examples. Discussing the limits of reason in morals, for instance, he dryly notes that *“’Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger”* ([The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#:~:text=effects,the%20greatest%20and%20most%20valuable)) – a jarring image that makes his point: reason alone cannot adjudicate ultimate preferences. And in a particularly introspective moment at the end of Book I, Hume offers a memorable personal vignette that humanizes his abstract skepticism. After chapters of relentless doubt – about causation, the self, even whether any rational belief is possible – Hume admits he’s driven himself into a corner of despair. *“The intense view of these manifold contradictions and imperfections in human reason,”* he confesses, *“has so wrought upon me… that I am ready to reject all belief and reasoning, and can look upon no opinion even as more probable or likely than another. Where am I, or what?… I am confounded with all these questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable condition imaginable”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=But%20what%20have%20I%20here,begin%20to%20fancy%20myself%20in)). This is Hume at his most vulnerable – the philosopher overwhelmed by his own critique of reason, suffering what he calls a “philosophical melancholy and delirium.” But then comes the twist: nature’s common sense rescues him. **“Most fortunately it happens,”** he writes with a breath of relief, **“that since reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, *nature herself suffices to that purpose, and cures me of this philosophical melancholy and delirium*, either by relaxing this bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impression of my senses, which obliterate all these chimeras. **I dine, I play a game of back-gammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends**; and when after three or four hours’ amusement, I would return to these speculations, **they appear so cold, and strained, and ridiculous, that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any farther***” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=Most%20fortunately%20it%20happens%2C%20that,enter%20into%20them%20any%20farther)). Here Hume the man steps into the text, effectively saying: *I’m a skeptic – until the pub or the parlour calls!* The everyday passions of life whisk him out of fatal doubt. He finds himself “absolutely and necessarily determin’d to live, and talk, and act like other people,” going along with common beliefs despite his abstract qualms ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=Here%20then%20I%20find%20myself,senses%20and%20understanding%3B%20and%20in)). This is not a refutation of his skepticism but a humble acknowledgement that humans are not built to dwell in high-wire doubt permanently. Hume thus ends the *Treatise* on a note of **mitigated skepticism**: reason’s ability to attain ultimate truth is infirm, but we manage anyway by the instincts of nature, custom, and social living. It is a poignant and wry conclusion to a work that had boldly questioned the most basic assumptions of philosophy. 

In sum, *A Treatise of Human Nature* is an astonishing tour de force – “**one great experiment**” in applying an empirical microscope to the mind. Hume examines how we form ideas, why we believe in causation and external objects, what role reason and passion play, and how moral principles arise. He does it in a style that is methodical yet engaging, blending lucid argument with literary flair. Though Hume would later express disappointment at its initial reception (the book “fell dead-born from the press,” as he put it ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Never%20literary%20attempt%20was%20more,neglected%20in%20my%20early%20youth))), the *Treatise* stands as the wellspring of Hume’s philosophy. All his later works would refine, popularize, or extend the insights first presented in this youthful masterpiece. As we turn now to those later works, we will see Hume returning to the *Treatise*’s themes – sometimes smoothing the sharp edges, sometimes deepening the analysis – but always guided by the empirical, skeptical spirit he had unleashed in 1739.

## *Essays, Moral and Political* (1741–1742)

Chastened by the *Treatise*’s lack of splash, Hume changed tack. In 1741 and 1742 he published two slim volumes titled *Essays, Moral and Political*, a series of short, accessible essays on a wide range of topics. These essays mark Hume’s turn toward the **“easy and obvious” philosophy** addressed to a general educated audience. Their style is polished, conversational, and often wittily ironical. While the *Treatise* plumbed the depths of human understanding in a systematic way, the *Essays* lightly explore particular questions of aesthetics, politics, economics, and religion with an empirical sensibility. Hume himself noted that these essays “made no great noise at their first appearance,” but they were *far* better received than the heavy tome that preceded them ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Never%20literary%20attempt%20was%20more,neglected%20in%20my%20early%20youth)). Through them, Hume found his readership and honed his talent for the shorter form, even as he continued to develop his philosophical ideas in a more popular idiom.

The subjects of the essays range widely, reflecting Hume’s curious and sociable mind. In **“Of the Delicacy of Taste and Passion,”** he contrasts the finely attuned taste of a true critic (sensitive to small beauties and deformities in art) with the delicacy of passion (a temperament easily hurt or offended in life), drawing a gentle lesson that improving one’s taste can actually moderate one’s passions by focusing the mind on art rather than slights. In **“Of the Liberty of the Press,”** Hume – writing in an age when Britain’s press was relatively free – boldly argues that a free press is an essential safeguard in a mixed government, noting that in a free country, *“**the spirit of party… venting itself in print, is never dangerous**; but when restrained, it vents itself in sedition and conspiracy”* (a decidedly modern-sounding defense of open expression). Many essays delve into British politics and history: **“That Politics may be reduced to a Science”** suggests that by studying history we can draw general maxims of good government, since human nature remains the same and similar causes produce similar effects in political societies. Hume contends that while we cannot have the certainty of mathematics in politics, experience points to *probabilities* and guidelines – a characteristically moderate empiricism applied to statecraft. 

One of the most famous essays is **“Of Superstition and Enthusiasm”** (1741), where Hume’s skepticism about religion finds early expression. Here he dissects two pathological forms of religion. **Superstition**, he says, arises from weakness, fear, and ignorance: *“In such a state of mind, infinite unknown evils are dreaded from unknown agents… and where real objects of terror are wanting, the soul… finds imaginary ones”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=These%20two%20species%20of%20false,As%20these%20enemies%20are%20entirely)). The superstitious person, frightened and melancholy, enslaves himself to priests, rituals, and ascetic practices in hopes of appeasing these vague fears. **“Weakness, fear, melancholy, together with ignorance, are, therefore, the true sources of Superstition,”** Hume concludes bluntly ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=unaccountable%2C%20and%20consist%20in%20ceremonies%2C,the%20true%20sources%20of%20Superstition)). **Enthusiasm**, by contrast, arises from an “unaccountable elevation” of mind, a presumptuous confidence and pride: when someone is giddy with good fortune or a fervid imagination, they may fancy themselves in direct communion with the divine. “The imagination swells with great but confused conceptions… everything mortal and perishable vanishes… *Hence arise raptures and transports;* and confidence and presumption, still increasing, these raptures… are attributed to divine inspiration,” Hume writes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=But%20the%20mind%20of%20man,still%20encreasing%2C%20these%20raptures%2C%20being)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=and%20confidence%20and%20presumption%20still,Hope%2C%20pride)). The enthusiast essentially *hallucinates* a special favor from God. “Hope, pride, presumption, a warm imagination, **together with ignorance, are… the true sources of Enthusiasm**,” Hume notes, neatly paralleling his diagnosis of superstition ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=faculties%2C%20are%20attributed%20to%20the,the%20true%20sources%20of%20Enthusiasm)). While superstition makes people abject and servile (easy prey for priests), enthusiasm makes them bold and intractable (apt to challenge all authority, convinced of their own inspiration). Hume then reflects on the social effects: *“My first reflection is, That **superstition is favorable to priestly power**, and enthusiasm to the power of the magistrate”*, he observes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=Polytheism%20or%20idolatrous%20worship%2C%20being,is%20opposite%20both%20in%20its)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=advantages%20and%20disadvantages,of%20object%20seems%20naturally%20to)). A superstitious populace is docile for clergy but can be a threat to civil authority (since priests might incite fears); an enthusiastic sectary, however, might shun priests and established churches, but could just as well become a revolutionary if his “inspiration” runs contrary to the government. Hume’s contempt for both extremes is palpable – they are “corruptions of true religion,” as he says at the outset ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=T%20HAT%20the%20corruption%20of,the%20corruptions%20of%20true%20religion)), and both are fueled by **ignorance**. The cool tone of analysis thinly veils a sharp critique: *real* religion, he implies, should be reasonable and moderate – a note he will strike more forcefully in later works. Already, though, Hume the naturalist of religion is at work, explaining religious excesses in terms of psychological causes (fear or exuberance) rather than divine grace.

Other essays in these volumes address economics and politics in pioneering ways. **“Of Commerce”**, **“Of Money”**, and **“Of the Balance of Trade”** (1741–42) collectively outline an early free-trade, pro-commerce viewpoint – quite radical at the time. Hume argues against the mercantile notion that wealth is a fixed pie of gold and silver. Instead, he sees trade and manufacturing as mutually enriching, advocating for low trade barriers and the benefits of industry. **“Industry, knowledge, and humanity, are linked together by an indissoluble chain,”** he writes in *Of Refinement in the Arts*, suggesting that commerce polishes and improves society. In *Of Commerce*, Hume famously observes that **the greatness of a state and the happiness of its people go hand in hand with the growth of trade and manufacturing** – countering the old idea that a government might need its subjects to be poor to be strong. *“Industry and arts and trade encrease the power of the sovereign as well as the happiness of the subjects; **and that policy is violent which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of individuals***,” Hume asserts ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=susceptible,from%20a%20few%20considerations%2C%20which)). A healthy polity, in his view, encourages private prosperity, which in turn fills the public coffers in times of need. He even prefigures Adam Smith’s invisible hand: by pursuing luxury and gain, individuals unknowingly contribute to national strength. For example, he argues that a flourishing commerce encourages *more* production than mere subsistence farming ever could – people will work harder for fancy goods and comforts, generating surplus that can be taxed for public purposes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=Thus%20the%20greatness%20of%20the,the%20stock%20of%20labour%20of)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=Co%2013%2C%20Mil%20262)). **“Furnish him with manufactures and commodities, and he will do it of himself,”** Hume writes of the laborer, noting that once accustomed to industrious improvement of his lot, a person can even spare a part of his labor for the state (in taxes or service) without hardship ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=Thus%20the%20greatness%20of%20the,the%20stock%20of%20labour%20of)). Thus personal motivations and public good align. Hume, the supposed skeptic, emerges in these essays as a startlingly **modern thinker in economics**: he explains how foreign trade enriches all nations, how **“a kingdom, that has a large import and export, must abound more with industry… and is, therefore, more powerful, as well as richer and happier”** than a closed economy ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=The%20same%20method%20of%20reasoning,It%20is%2C%20therefore)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=its%20exports%2C%20it%20produces%20labour,And%20the)). Such insights would influence the classical economists of the late 18th century. It’s a reminder that Hume’s empiricism was not confined to the lecture hall – he was observing the burgeoning commercial society around him and drawing general lessons. Crucially, these lessons were grounded in human nature as Hume saw it: people respond to incentives (profit, luxury), and from these individual actions, social benefits can flow. This faith in **experience and common life as teachers** pervades even the most practical of Hume’s essays.

What ties the *Essays, Moral and Political* together philosophically is Hume’s consistent appeal to experience, observation, and a well-tempered reason. Whether he’s talking about party politics in “Of the Parties of Great Britain” or reflecting on the pleasures of scholarly retirement in “Of the Study of History,” Hume writes as a **philosopher in the world**, using the evidence of history and daily life to draw his conclusions. There is a marked skepticism toward abstruse theory without evidence. In **“Of the First Principles of Government,”** for instance, Hume famously notes that it’s not consent or fear alone that keep governments in power but opinion – the opinions people hold of authority, interest, and right. That insight (that all authority ultimately rests on opinion, since force alone is never enough) comes straight from attending to how real governments function over time ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=The%20other%20species%20of%20philosophers,While%20they%20attempt%20this%20arduous)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=literature%2C%20that%20philosophy%20should%20not,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)). In essay after essay, Hume’s method is to gather anecdotes, historical examples, or casual observations and then induce a general principle. It’s the same inductive spirit as the *Treatise* but applied more gently and with a pragmatic bent. 

The tone of the *Essays* is also worth savoring. Hume’s voice is urbane, often with a sly humor. In “Of Essay-Writing,” he portrays the essayist’s task as joining the company of polite conversation, mediating between learned recluses and the sociable world. The ease and polish of Hume’s writing here practice what he preaches: philosophy should **engage human life**, not withdraw from it. Even when dissecting *human folly*, Hume is never shrill. For example, concluding “Of Superstition and Enthusiasm,” he does not call for abolishing religion but rather counsels the magistrate to promote liberty and learning as antidotes: if people are free to think and educated to debate, wild fanaticism is likely to be tamed over time. And indeed, he remarks, in modern times whenever sects have lost political power, they tend to lose their violent enthusiasm too ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=balanced%20,pleased%20with%20different%20and%20opposite)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=sole%20object%20of%20devotion%20is,and%20rancour%2C%20the%20most%20furious)). His recommendation comes in a dry aside: it is **“thus the magistrate may hope to *domesticate*, if not utterly *extinguish*, the demon of fanaticism,”** a line that gleams with Hume’s quiet wit (the notion of *domesticating* a demon captures his mix of realism and irony).

In summary, the *Essays, Moral and Political* show Hume as a **philosopher of common sense and humane observation**. While not a systematic treatise, these essays extend Hume’s core ideas: the sovereignty of experience, the critique of fanaticism, the analysis of human psychology in public life. They also reveal new facets – Hume the political economist, Hume the historian-in-training, Hume the social critic – all unified by an easy clarity of style. These writings helped establish Hume’s reputation in his lifetime as an essayist and man of letters. More importantly, they set the stage for his next major works, where he returned to the deeper philosophical questions of the *Treatise* but with the lessons of accessibility and clarity learned from the essay format. We now turn to those works – the two *Enquiries* – in which Hume refines the *Treatise*’s insights and presents them in their most elegant form.

## *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* (1748)

By 1748, Hume was ready to revisit the challenging terrain of Book I of the *Treatise* – human understanding, knowledge, and skepticism – but this time in a shorter, more refined form. The result was *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*, published under his own name and destined to become one of the most influential philosophical works in English. The *Enquiry* is in many ways a **second edition** of the epistemology and psychology of the *Treatise*, “cast anew,” as Hume put it ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20had%20always%20entertained%20a,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)), to reach a broader audience and address criticisms. It is organized into twelve sections, each a self-contained essay on topics ranging from the different kinds of philosophy, to the idea of necessary connection, to miracles and the afterlife. Hume’s writing in the *Enquiry* is crisp, confident, and richly illustrated with examples. He trims away some of the youthful excess of the *Treatise* while sharpening the presentation of key arguments. The result is a work of **philosophical clarity** that both popularized Hume’s earlier insights and, in some aspects, subtly shifted their emphasis.

The *Enquiry* opens with a contrast between two “species of philosophy.” One is the easy, popular philosophy that appeals to sentiment and tries to make people virtuous by painting pleasing pictures (much like the essays Hume had been writing). The other is the **accurate and abstruse philosophy** that digs into the foundations of understanding, even if it appears dry or difficult ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=M%20ORAL%20philosophy%2C%20or%20the,fitted%20to%20please%20the%20imagination)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=The%20other%20species%20of%20philosophers,While%20they%20attempt%20this%20arduous)). Hume acknowledges that the “easy” kind will always be more warmly received – *“the easy and obvious philosophy will always, with the generality of mankind, have the preference above the accurate and abstruse”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=It%20is%20certain%20that%20the,moulds%20the%20heart%20and%20affections)) – yet he makes a case for the deeper inquiry. It’s needed to shore up the foundations of all knowledge and to dispel the clouds of confusion. In an implicit self-portrait, Hume suggests the best philosophy might combine these approaches: engage the imagination and sentiments, but not lose sight of rigorous analysis ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=different%20manners%3B%20each%20of%20which,fitted%20to%20please%20the%20imagination)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=literature%2C%20that%20philosophy%20should%20not,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)). This introduction sets the tone. The *Enquiry* aims to be an approachable gateway into abstruse philosophy – a balance Hume achieves through masterful prose and structure. 

### Hume’s Empiricist Creed Restated

In Sections II and III, Hume reintroduces the basic tenets of his empiricism. He reiterates the distinction between **impressions and ideas**: impressions are our lively, first-hand experiences (sensations, emotions), while ideas are the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=The%20other%20species%20of%20philosophers,and%20deformity%2C%20without%20being%20able)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=truth%20and%20falsehood%2C%20vice%20and,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)). Crucially, Hume states as an empirical fact that **all our ideas are derived from antecedent impressions**. This is the “copy principle” again, but formulated succinctly. He invites any skeptic of this principle to produce a counter-example: an idea that isn’t copied from some similar impression. Perhaps anticipating critics, he acknowledges one conceivable exception – the famous missing shade of blue (the idea that one might, having seen all shades of blue except one, be able to imagine the missing shade). But Hume notes this singular curiosity “does not so much *invalidate*” his general maxim as prove how “extraordinary” the circumstance must be to make an exception ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=E%201.3%2C%20SBN%206)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=man%20chiefly%20as%20born%20for,in%20a%20proper%20contrast%3B%20and)). For all practical purposes, **“**our ideas reach no farther than our experience**” – a phrase that could stand as the motto of Hume’s philosophy.

With this foundation, Hume classifies knowledge into two categories that later philosophers would dub “Hume’s Fork.” In Section IV, “Sceptical Doubts concerning the Operations of the Understanding,” he distinguishes **“relations of ideas”** from **“matters of fact.”** Relations of ideas are a priori truths – like mathematics and logic – which are necessarily true but tell us nothing about the world of existence. Matters of fact are synthetic, contingent truths about the world, known through experience (for example, “the sun will rise tomorrow” is a matter of fact, known by past observation, not by pure reason). Hume points out that **matters of fact can never be known with absolute certainty**; their contraries are always conceivable. We can’t *prove* by reason alone that the sun must rise tomorrow – we expect it because it always has, but we can coherently imagine it not rising. So what is the foundation of all our reasoning about matters of fact? Experience of cause and effect, Hume answers. **All reasonings concerning fact are based on the relation of cause and effect**; we infer unseen facts (like the existence of fire from seeing smoke) because we presume a causal connection ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=literature%2C%20that%20philosophy%20should%20not,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=truth%20and%20falsehood%2C%20vice%20and,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)). But here Hume presses the skeptical doubt: how do we *know* cause and effect? Not by reason a priori – for any effect, we can always imagine a different cause. We only know specific causal connections from *experience*. **Cause-effect beliefs are thus entirely a posteriori**, grounded in repeated observation.

This leads to one of Hume’s central contentions: **our inferences from experience are not founded on reason, but on custom**. In Section IV and its sequel Section V (“Sceptical Solution of these Doubts”), Hume carefully examines induction – how we project past experience to the future. Suppose you have repeatedly observed that bread nourishes. On what basis do you believe this next piece of bread will nourish you? All the reasoner can say is: in the past, it has always done so. But that assumes the future will resemble the past – which is exactly what’s at issue. Hume famously argues that **no logical argument can justify induction**. If we claim “Nature is uniform – the future will mimic the past,” that claim itself is not known by reason (since it’s not a relation of ideas) and can only be supported by… past experience of uniformity, which is circular. Instead, Hume offers a psychological explanation: **habit or custom** is “the great guide of life” that leads us to expect the future will be like the past ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=Most%20fortunately%20it%20happens%2C%20that,enter%20into%20them%20any%20farther)). After experiencing constant conjunction of events (bread → nourishment, flame → heat, B following A), the mind develops a habit of associating the two and anticipating one upon the appearance of the other. *“All these operations are a species of natural instincts,”* he writes, *“which no reasoning or process of the thought and understanding is able, either to produce, or to prevent”*. The *Enquiry* captures this insight in a memorable maxim: **“Custom, then, is the great guide of human life”**, it being that principle alone which renders our experience useful to us ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=Most%20fortunately%20it%20happens%2C%20that,enter%20into%20them%20any%20farther)). By custom we expect similar causes will have similar effects – not by any act of reasoning. This is Hume’s “skeptical solution”: he doesn’t *solve* the logical problem of induction (he thinks it’s insoluble), but he dissolves our anxiety by showing that nature has seen to it that we *do* rely on induction via habit, and that’s just part of how the human animal operates. 

One might think this conclusion deeply undermines human knowledge – and indeed, it does put strict limits on what we can justify. But Hume turns it into a kind of practical wisdom. He notes that even skeptics must live and act, and they inevitably trust their habits. Thus a moderate skepticism, which recognizes the limitations of reason but goes along with custom and common sense, is the only viable stance. In the closing Section XII, “Of the Academical or Sceptical Philosophy,” Hume distinguishes between a **mitigated skepticism** he advocates and a destructive, excessive skepticism he considers unlivable. The mitigated skeptic accepts that we should confine our investigations to subjects suitable to the human faculties (math, natural science, common life) and refrain from speculations beyond experience. We use our reason where we can (in relations of ideas), but humbly acknowledge where we must rely on instinct and custom (matters of fact). Hume even suggests a striking test for meaningful discourse – a razor to shave off nonsense: *“When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles,”* he writes, *“what havoc must we make! If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; ask, *Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?* No. *Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?* No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=Here%20then%20I%20find%20myself,senses%20and%20understanding%3B%20and%20in)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=this%20blind%20submission%20I%20shew,such%20an%20abuse%20of%20time)). This fiery passage (the famous “commit it to the flames” dictum) is Hume’s dramatic flourish capping the *Enquiry*. It encapsulates his entire approach: unless a work deals in either logical/mathematical truths or empirical reasoning, it is empty. Theology, mysticism, purely abstract metaphysics – these have no genuine content on Hume’s terms. It’s a bold provocation, especially in an age when volumes of divinity were treasured. But Hume delivers it in cool, matter-of-fact prose, as the logical consequence of his empiricist philosophy. This is mitigated skepticism with a vengeance: it spares the useful and evident, and tosses out the rest as **“sophistry and illusion.”**

### The Idea of Necessary Connection

A highlight of the *Enquiry* is Section VII, “Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion,” where Hume zeros in on the very heart of the notion of causation. This section rephrases and strengthens the *Treatise*’s account of what we mean by a “necessary” link between cause and effect. Hume asks, when we say A *must* cause B, what is this “must”? If we examine any single instance of cause and effect, we perceive only that B followed A – nothing like a literal force or necessity in the objects. The necessity is something **felt by the mind** when reflecting on many such instances. Hume explains that after repeated exposure to A followed by B, we experience a transition in the mind – an *expectation* that B will follow whenever A occurs. This internal impression (the feeling of expectation, the custom operating on the imagination) is the source of the idea of necessity. “We have no other notion of cause and effect,” Hume writes, “but that of certain objects, which have been *always conjoined* together, and which in all past instances have been found inseparable” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=and%20every%20part%20of%20it%3A,their%20most%20minute%20parts%2C%20are)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20analogy%20in%20each%20step,or%20reason%20from%20the%20great)). The impression that gives us the idea of a necessary connection is just the felt *determination* of the mind – the way our thought moves from one object to the idea of its usual attendant. In plainer terms, **necessary connection is not a feature of objective reality, but a projection of our mental habit**. When we say “Fire *must* cause heat,” we are really voicing the strong expectation forged in us by constant experience of fire being followed by heat. Strip away that psychological expectation, and all that remains is that in past cases, fire was followed by heat. As Hume concisely puts it: *“We may define a cause to be *an object, followed by another, and where all the objects similar to the first are followed by objects similar to the second*. Or, in other words, where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed”* (a definition focusing on constant conjunction) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20analogy%20in%20each%20step,or%20reason%20from%20the%20great)). But he immediately adds a second definition: a cause can be defined as *“an object followed by another, and *whose appearance always conveys the thought to that other”*** ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20analogy%20in%20each%20step,or%20reason%20from%20the%20great)). The second definition highlights the mind’s contribution – *conveys the thought* – pointing to that feeling of determination as the essence of causal necessity. This psychological analysis was revolutionary: it effectively dethroned the idea of causation from the metaphysical realm and relocated it in human expectation and mental habits. The *Enquiry* delivers this insight in beautifully clear paragraphs, using examples like the collision of billiard balls to show we never perceive any necessity – we just learn from experience what to expect ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=and%20every%20part%20of%20it%3A,their%20most%20minute%20parts%2C%20are)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=as%20in%20a%20machine%20of,causes%2C%20therefore%2C%20must%20be%20resembling)). Hume notes that even children and animals learn from experience, reinforcing that this is an instinctual process, not a rational insight (Section IX, “Of the Reason of Animals,” makes the point explicitly that beasts learn by custom just as we do). 

The implications of Hume’s account of necessary connection are profound. It implies that what philosophers and scientists often sought – an *underlying power or force* in causes – is unknowable. We see sequences, that’s all. Hume doesn’t deny the *existence* of powers in nature; he says we have no idea of any such power beyond the observed regularity. Even our idea of *power* is just an abstraction from the feeling of being compelled by custom. Thus Hume in the *Enquiry* sides firmly with an empirical humble stance: stick to describing how things *in fact* behave, don’t speculate about hidden essences. This was a direct challenge to rationalist thinkers who spoke confidently of “necessary forces” or to theologians who invoked “necessary being.” Hume’s razor had sliced necessity itself down to size – from an objective chain in the world to a subjective inference in the mind.

### Miracles and the Limits of Testimony

The *Enquiry* also ventures into more applied topics. One famous section is Section X, “Of Miracles,” where Hume brings his theory of evidence to bear on religious claims of miraculous events. This section is a small masterwork of skeptical reasoning and elegant argumentation, and it stirred significant controversy (so much so that it was initially published without an author’s name). Hume begins by defining a miracle as “a violation of the laws of nature” – that is, an event utterly at odds with uniform experience, like the dead rising or iron floating without support ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20analogy%20in%20each%20step,or%20reason%20from%20the%20great)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20analogy%20in%20each%20step,or%20reason%20from%20the%20great)). He then argues that by the very nature of the case, **miracles are exceedingly unlikely** – so unlikely that one could never rationally believe a miracle has occurred based on second-hand testimony. Hume lays out a simple rule: in evaluating testimony, one should weigh the probability that the testimony is true against the probability that the event testified to occurred. Since human error and deception are common, and genuine violations of natural law are (by definition) unheard-of in our experience, it will always be more probable that the testimony is false (through mistake, or fraud, or exaggeration) than that a miracle truly happened. *“No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle,”* Hume writes, *“unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=D%2010)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=Epicurus%27s%20old%20questions%20are%20yet,willing%3F%20whence%20then%20is%20evil)). This witty formulation means: we should only believe we’ve witnessed a miracle if denying it would itself wreak havoc on our understanding of nature. For instance, if a lot of sane, reputable people swore they saw a dead man resurrected, which is more likely – that all these witnesses are somehow mistaken or lying (which unfortunately is very possible in human affairs), or that the dead man truly came back (which goes against everything we know of biology)? Hume insists the balance of probability will always favor a natural explanation over a supernatural one. And indeed, he goes further, pointing out that reports of miracles typically abound in ignorant or ancient times, and different religions’ miracle claims cancel each other out (each faith rejects the others’ supposed wonders). Hume’s cool demolition of the credibility of miracle stories is an application of his general maxim: **a wise person “proportions his belief to the evidence.”** Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence – and in the case of miracles, Hume believes no human testimony could ever reach that bar.

What’s striking is how Hume couches this skeptical point in calm, almost cheerful prose, illustrating with imaginative examples. He invents a tale of an Indian prince who had never seen frozen water, and on hearing of water becoming solid (ice), initially disbelieved it as a violation of nature – here, Hume concedes, the prince was wrong because the event, though unusual to him, was consistent with broader experience and physics. But for a *real* violation of nature, like a resurrection, Hume concludes no amount of testimony should convince us. This reasoning undercuts one of the major props of religious belief – scripture and testimony of miracles – using Hume’s empirical epistemology. It’s done with courteous language (“I beg the limitations here made may be remarked,” he says, reassuring he respects honest testimony) even as the substantive message is devastating to supernatural claims ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=Epicurus%27s%20old%20questions%20are%20yet,willing%3F%20whence%20then%20is%20evil)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=You%20ascribe%2C%20Cleanthes%2C%20,At)). This delicate handling (velvet glove on an iron fist of logic) is Hume’s trademark in the *Enquiry*. He achieves a tone of a reasonable friend sharing commonsense doubts, rather than an aggressive polemicist – which made his skeptical ideas all the more insidious to opponents.

### The Legacy of the First *Enquiry*

When Hume later reflected on his works, he noted that the *Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* “**was not much more successful**” at first than the *Treatise* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20had%20always%20entertained%20a,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)). Indeed, the *Enquiry* didn’t cause an immediate sensation. But over time it became and remains the most read of Hume’s philosophical writings. In it, Hume distilled his thoughts on knowledge, cause, free will (Section VIII reaffirms his compatibilist view in plainer terms), and skepticism in a way that set the agenda for modern philosophy. Scottish and German philosophers, from Thomas Reid to Immanuel Kant, took Hume’s *Enquiry* as the exemplar of empiricism and the challenge to be answered. Kant famously said Hume’s arguments on causation “awoke him from his dogmatic slumber.” The clarity of the *Enquiry* ensured that its questions – How can we justify induction? What is causality? Are miracles believable? – became central questions of Enlightenment thought.

For Hume, the *Enquiry* represented a kind of redemption of the *Treatise*. He had extracted the core insights of Book I, pruned the digressions (gone, for example, is the long discourse on space and time from the *Treatise*), and presented the whole in a **lucid, engaging sequence**. It reads almost like a well-delivered lecture series, complete with anticipations of objections and vivid examples. By the end, the reader is invited to embrace a philosophy at once humbling and empowering: humbling, because it admits the narrow limits of human understanding (we are far from omniscient rational beings); empowering, because within those limits we know how to proceed (through observation, experiment, calculation) and how to steer clear of nonsense. “When we trace up the human understanding to its first principles,” Hume concludes, we’ll be convinced of its *“narrow limits”*, and will **“find what a *proportionable* shade of doubt falls upon the most demonstrative sciences”**, but also we’ll avoid the despair of extreme skepticism by keeping to common life and experimental science ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=Here%20then%20I%20find%20myself,senses%20and%20understanding%3B%20and%20in)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/full#:~:text=this%20blind%20submission%20I%20shew,such%20an%20abuse%20of%20time)). It’s a measured, mature position. 

To summarize, *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* takes the reader on a tour of Hume’s reformed epistemology: from the origin of ideas in impressions, through the nature of causal inference as custom, to the examination of specific challenging topics like liberty, miracles, and the soul’s immortality (which Hume addresses with similar skepticism in Section XI). In each case, Hume demonstrates the **power of empirical reflection** – looking to how we actually think and what evidence we actually have – to dissolve or deflate grand philosophical mysteries. The work is a model of elegant argumentation, combining philosophical depth with a light touch. After reading it, one indeed feels the “vivacity of conversation” Hume wanted to capture by writing in an easy style ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=Any%20point%20of%20doctrine%2C%20which,appear%20neither%20tedious%20nor%20redundant)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=D%200)). We now proceed to Hume’s next great work, where he turns his attention to the foundation of morals with the same clarity and humane perspective.

## *An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals* (1751)

Hume’s own favorite among his writings was neither the bold *Treatise* nor the brilliant *Enquiry on Understanding*, but a later work: *An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals*, published in 1751. He even declared in his autobiography that this work “**is, of all my writings, incomparably the best**” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Discourses%2C%20the%20only%20work%20of,and%20unobserved%20into%20the%20world)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=London%2C%20my%20Enquiry%20concerning%20the,and%20unobserved%20into%20the%20world)). The *Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals* (often called the Second Enquiry) revisits the territory of the *Treatise* Book III on ethics, but with the benefit of a decade’s further thought and a matured style. The result is a graceful, penetrating treatise on morality that stands on its own, independent of the *Treatise*. If the first *Enquiry* taught us why we believe what we do about the world, the second *Enquiry* explores why we praise what we do in the realm of character and action. Hume’s thesis can be simply put: **morality is founded on sentiment (feeling), not on reason alone**. But the *Enquiry* goes much further in mapping out *which* sentiments underlie our moral judgments, offering a compelling account of virtues as qualities useful or agreeable to someone (either to the person who has them or to others around). It’s a theory that makes *human well-being* and *social utility* the center of ethics, rather than divine commands or abstract rational duties. Hume’s tone throughout is serene and reasonable, occasionally rising to heartfelt eloquence when describing the beauty of the virtues. He emerges here as not just a skeptic, but a *moralist* in the best sense – one who wants to understand and promote the virtues that make life better for everyone.

The *Enquiry concerning Morals* opens by confronting a debate that was lively then (and still is): Are moral distinctions derived from **reason or from sentiment**? Hume frames the question clearly in Section I: Do we discern good and evil by some rational argument – a chain of thought – or by an “immediate feeling and finer internal sense”? ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=There%20has%20been%20a%20controversy,constitution%20of%20the%20human%20species)). In other words, when we say “Kindness is good” or “Murder is evil,” is that akin to a conclusion of the understanding, or is it an expression of how we feel about those things? Hume grants that at first glance, both reason and sentiment seem involved. But he argues that **reason alone cannot be the source of morals**. Reason can inform us of the facts – e.g., that an act will cause pain – but **whether the pain of others matters to me is a matter of feeling**. If someone had no feelings of compassion or humanity, no “internal taste” for the happiness of others, no amount of logical argument could induce moral approbation in them. As Hume succinctly says, **“Morals… have an influence on actions and affections”** (they motivate and stir us), “but reason alone… can never have any such influence” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=There%20has%20been%20a%20controversy,constitution%20of%20the%20human%20species)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=REASON%2C%20or%20from%20SENTIMENT%3B%20whether,constitution%20of%20the%20human%20species)). Therefore, morality must rely on sentiment to move us. To illustrate: reason might calculate that a charitable donation will feed ten children, but the *approval* of charity comes from a sentiment of benevolence or humanity that makes us value the feeding of those children. If someone lacked all fellow-feeling, reason could not by itself manufacture a moral sense in them.

Hume is careful to clarify that he doesn’t mean morality is purely subjective whim. On the contrary, he believes nature has provided a *common* human sentiment – a *“standard of taste”* in morals akin to the standard of beauty – which makes our moral judgments largely agree. This sentiment is the feeling of **approbation** we experience when contemplating a character trait or action that is beneficial or pleasing from a general point of view. Hume identifies this feeling with what we might call **sympathy** or *humanity* – a concern for the well-being of others. Throughout the *Enquiry*, he argues that when we call something virtuous, it is because it triggers in any spectator a pleasing sentiment, typically by **being useful or immediately agreeable** either to society or to the person who has the quality. He famously summarizes: *“No quality is approved of as virtuous, unless it produces *pleasure* to a spectator by the mere survey”*. And what produces this pleasure? Qualities that are *useful or agreeable*. In a key passage (Section IX), Hume writes, *“**Every quality of the mind, which is useful or agreeable to the person himself or to others, communicates a pleasure to the spectator, engages his esteem, and is admitted under the honourable denomination of virtue or merit**”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=be%20allowed%2C%20that%20every%20quality,fidelity%2C%20honour%2C%20veracity%2C%20allegiance%2C%20chastity)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=be%20allowed%2C%20that%20every%20quality,fidelity%2C%20honour%2C%20veracity%2C%20allegiance%2C%20chastity)). Conversely, qualities that are immediately unpleasant or harmful evoke disapproval and are called vices. This is a powerful unifying idea: **Utility and agreeableness are the chief sources of moral approval**.

Hume supports this thesis by surveying various virtues. The *Enquiry* is structured such that after some general principles in Sections I–III, it considers different classes of virtues: benevolence (Section II), justice (Section III and Appendix III), the political society that justice gives rise to (Section IV), usefulness (Section V, pointedly titled “Why Utility Pleases”), qualities useful to oneself (Section VI, like prudence, temperance), qualities immediately agreeable to oneself (Section VII, like cheerfulness, dignity), and qualities immediately agreeable to others (Section VIII, like wit, good manners). This tour of virtues is empirical in flavor: Hume collects examples and asks *why* do we praise this trait? Take **benevolence** (generosity, kindness). It’s obviously a virtue. Hume points out how universally admired great philanthropists and heroes of humanity are, and asks: Is our admiration grounded in self-interest or rational deduction? No – we often admire benevolence in distant times or foreign nations where it has no impact on us. Instead, *“the interests of society appear to be… inseparable from the interests of the individual”* by virtue of our natural sympathies ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=And%20as%20every%20quality%2C%20which,Celibacy)). We *like* seeing others happy; a character that promotes others’ happiness gives us pleasure to contemplate. Thus **benevolence is virtuous because of its utility to others (and the sympathetic pleasure we take in that)**.

Now consider **justice**, which was a tricky case in the *Treatise*. In the *Enquiry*, Hume reiterates his view that justice (consistency in keeping promises, respecting property, etc.) is an artificial virtue – its merit entirely derives from the social usefulness of a system of justice. “**Public utility is the sole origin of justice**,” he states unequivocally ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=T%20HAT%20Justice%20is%20useful,this%20virtue%20are%20the%20sole)). Keeping a promise or refraining from theft isn’t *naturally* appealing (in some situations it might even conflict with immediate kindness), but it is so essential for the peace and order of society that we cultivate a moral sentiment in favor of justice. Hume asks us to imagine a scenario of extreme abundance or conversely extreme disaster – in neither scenario would the current strict rules of property make sense ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=UTILITY%2C%20which%20results%20to%20the,malice%3A%20By%20rendering%20justice%20totally)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=If%20we%20examine%20the%20particular,society%2C%20that%20men%27s%20possessions%20should)). Thus, the virtue of justice is entirely contextual, grounded on its necessity for societal well-being in normal life. Hume argues that we praise just actions not *because* they are rational deductions, but *because* we have been taught to see the long-term benefit they serve: *“The necessity of justice to the support of society is the *sole* foundation of that virtue”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=In%20all%20determinations%20of%20morality%2C,on%20any%20side%2C%20the%20true)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=T%20HAT%20Justice%20is%20useful,this%20virtue%20are%20the%20sole)). Our approval of justice is an indirect love of the public interest. And to those who claim we esteem justice as an absolute, Hume reminds them: if justice ceased to be useful, it would cease to be a virtue. For instance, strict justice might demand not returning to a madman a weapon he owns (since he might harm someone) – we readily suspend the rule in such cases because *human safety* is the very point of justice ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=Sometimes%20both%20utility%20and%20analogy,for%20reason%20alone%20to%20determine)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=The%20dilemma%20seems%20obvious%3A%20As,offspring%2C%20and%20other%20passions%2C%20arises)). 

One of Hume’s most appealing arguments comes in Section V, aptly titled “Why Utility Pleases.” It may seem obvious to us now that helping others is good because it’s useful – but Hume was writing against a tradition that tried to root morality in something more austere (God’s will, or pure reason’s dictates). Hume joyously vindicates *usefulness* as a source of moral sentiment. He notes how much we admire people like statesmen or reformers who do great services for society. We even praise inanimate things like fertile fields or medicine because of their utility ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=In%20all%20determinations%20of%20morality%2C,on%20any%20side%2C%20the%20true)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=How%20considerable%20a%20part%20of,9)). Utility, far from being a base consideration, genuinely *delights* us when we consider it socially. “In all determinations of morality, this circumstance of public utility is ever principally in view,” he writes; in any debate about what’s a duty, the best way to settle it is to ask which side *really benefits society* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=In%20all%20determinations%20of%20morality%2C,on%20any%20side%2C%20the%20true)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=life%2C%20concerning%20the%20bounds%20of,on%20any%20side%2C%20the%20true)). Through examples, Hume shows that virtues like honesty, fidelity, modesty, etc., either directly make people happier or make society function more smoothly – hence we applaud them. A striking point he makes is that even *monks* who practice celibacy or penance are quietly judged by society in terms of usefulness: “Celibacy, fasting, penance, mortification, self-denial, humility, silence, solitude” – all monkish virtues – are *not* esteemed by non-bigots, Hume says, precisely because they serve no *earthly* good ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=And%20as%20every%20quality%2C%20which,Celibacy)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=received%2C%20where%20men%20judge%20of,Celibacy)). (This was a jab at moralities that glorified self-denial with no benefit to anyone; Hume’s secular moral sense finds little value there.) Instead, qualities that spread joy or help humanity – cheerfulness, empathy, generosity – are celebrated. Hume encapsulates: *“no other [quality] will ever be received, where men judge of things by their natural, unprejudiced reason, without the delusive glosses of superstition”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=And%20as%20every%20quality%2C%20which,Celibacy)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=And%20as%20every%20quality%2C%20which,Celibacy)). In essence, *useful and agreeable* to self or others – that’s the gold standard of virtue. If someone proposed a “virtue” that isn’t one of those four categories (useful to others, useful to self, agreeable to others, agreeable to self), people wouldn’t truly regard it as a moral virtue.

While much of this might sound utilitarian, Hume balances utility with the category of **immediate agreeableness**. Some virtues don’t obviously help anyone, but they charm us. For instance, *wit* or *eloquence* or *personal charisma* – these we find agreeable and thus we tend to admire people who have them. They might not be “moral virtues” in a strict sense, but Hume is broad in his definition of virtue to include anything that naturally wins esteem. He even considers *good manners* and *conversational tact* as virtues immediately agreeable to others, and qualities like *cheerfulness* or *tranquility* as immediately agreeable to the person himself (which we also esteem, because a person in good spirits is more pleasant company, etc.) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=altogether%20in%20the%20possession%20of,without%20any%20argument%20or%20disputation)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=of%20useful%20or%20agreeable%2C%20the,or%20to%20others%2C%20the%20compleat)). Hume is painting a picture of the **moral sense as expansive and life-affirming**: we basically like whatever tends to happiness and dislike whatever tends to misery. He repeatedly emphasizes that this faculty is “implanted” in us by nature – it is part of being human to have sympathy and to derive pleasure from others’ well-being. So even though he’s a thoroughgoing naturalist (no references to divine commands or cosmic order appear in his account), his vision of morality is rather optimistic about human nature. *“The humanity of one man is the humanity of every one,”* he writes, insisting that all differences in moral outlook are due to education or circumstance, not a fundamentally different sentiment ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20denied%20the,ever%20so%20great%2C%20he%20must)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=ever%20seriously%20believe%2C%20that%20all,others%20are%20susceptible%20of%20like)). He had earlier argued in Section I that no one is really **amoral**: *“Let a man’s insensibility be ever so great, he must often be touched with the images of Right and Wrong”*, and if someone truly contends that all character differences are moot, Hume says the only cure for that person is to leave him be – eventually, by interacting with others, “he will be converted to the side of common sense and reason” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20denied%20the,ever%20so%20great%2C%20he%20must)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20denied%20the,as%20absolutely%20to%20deny%20all)). Hume has great faith in the *common moral sentiments* prevailing when uncloaked from superstition or sophistry.

One compelling illustration Hume gives of the primacy of feeling in morals is how **we judge characters in fiction or history**. We may read about people in ancient Rome or in a novel; we praise the virtuous hero and blame the villain with the same emotional engagement as if they were real contemporaries. Why? Not because it serves us – it’s simply that human nature is such that we love what appears noble and beneficial, and hate what appears cruel and destructive, regardless of time or place ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20denied%20the,ever%20so%20great%2C%20he%20must)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=ever%20seriously%20believe%2C%20that%20all,others%20are%20susceptible%20of%20like)). Such reactions are immediate and universal – a testament, Hume thinks, to the **objective stability of the moral sentiment** across humanity. Indeed, he claims that if we set aside religious bias, **moral judgments show far more consensus among people than, say, judgments of abstract philosophy**. Everyone agrees kind parents are better than abusive ones, but philosophers endlessly disagree on metaphysics. That to Hume indicates a firm grounding of morals in human nature itself.

The *Enquiry concerning Morals* is also notable for its elegant writing and even occasional warmth – something sometimes missing in the more dry first *Enquiry*. For instance, in extolling benevolence, Hume waxes almost poetic about the happiness of generous people: *“The immediate feeling of benevolence and friendship, humanity and kindness, is sweet, smooth, tender, and agreeable”*, he writes, adding that such virtues bring their own reward in the pleasing consciousness they produce ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=besides%20this%20advantage%2C%20common%20to,keep%20us%20in%20humour%20with)). There is an impression that Hume, often caricatured as a cold skeptic, actually had a deep appreciation for human goodness and wanted to celebrate it in philosophical terms. Even his discussion of *self-love* (Appendix II) argues that humans are not as narrowly self-interested as some (like Hobbes or Mandeville) suggested – we genuinely have other-regarding affections. While we do often enjoy being virtuous because it gives us self-satisfaction, that doesn’t mean all virtue reduces to selfishness. Hume takes pains to refute the cynical view that “virtue is just doing what’s pleasing to oneself.” If that were true, why do we honor people who sacrificed their own interests for others? Clearly, we distinguish *why* something pleases a person – if it pleases them because it’s beneficial to others, we call it virtue; if it pleases them to harm others, we call it vice. So even the “selfish” pleasure of a virtuous person (the pleasure of having done right) arises from an unselfish origin. Hume has little patience for those who deny the reality of virtue or altruism: *“I must confess I place a sundering line between such a man and myself,”* he says of someone who sees no difference between his own interests and morality ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/1/4/6#:~:text=dissolution%20of%20my%20body%2C%20I,no%20such%20principle%20in%20me)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/1/4/6#:~:text=and%20unprejudic%27d%20reflection%2C%20thinks%20he,no%20such%20principle%20in%20me)). In short, Hume champions a kind of **commonsense ethical realism**: there are real virtues that virtually all humans recognize (because nature gave us the capacity), and these virtues fundamentally relate to promoting happiness and ease either for society or the individual.

By the end of this Enquiry, Hume hopes to have shown that **ethics can be derived from human nature without resort to metaphysics or religion**. Virtue is not a mysterious Platonic form or a command from on high; it is what is *useful and agreeable*. And we have “**a common interest in each others’ happiness**” thanks to the gift of sympathy ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=In%20all%20determinations%20of%20morality%2C,on%20any%20side%2C%20the%20true)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=How%20considerable%20a%20part%20of,9)). This yields a remarkably **inclusive and humanistic morality**. For instance, Hume points out that when other societies have different customs (say, regarding modesty or property), what matters is the principle: do those customs serve the happiness of that society? If yes, then the virtue (modesty, justice) is present though the outward forms differ ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=If%20we%20examine%20the%20particular,society%2C%20that%20men%27s%20possessions%20should)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=and%20to%20support%20civil%20society%2C,breast%2C%20which%20nature%20has%20implanted)). He thus avoids narrow moralizing and focuses on underlying purpose.

If there is a recurring foil in the *Enquiry*, it is what Hume dubs “the *monkish virtues*” – qualities esteemed only under superstition, which produce no worldly good (think of an ascetic hermit who mortifies his flesh). Hume is politely scathing about these: they may be praised by some theologians, but they *do not naturally appeal* to human moral sentiments, he argues. *“Celibacy, fasting, penance, … humility, silence, solitude – for what reason are they everywhere rejected by men of sense, *except* that they serve no manner of purpose; neither advance a man’s fortune in the world, nor render him a more valuable member of society?”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=And%20as%20every%20quality%2C%20which,Celibacy)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=received%2C%20where%20men%20judge%20of,Celibacy)). In fact, Hume adds wryly, they make a person “**stupefied, useless, or miserable**” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=And%20as%20every%20quality%2C%20which,Celibacy)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/m/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L3909%20be%20allowed%2C,honourable%20denomination%20of%20virtue%20or)). This is as close to acerbic as Hume gets: essentially, he’s saying true morality coincides with what enlightened common sense values, whereas false, “superstitious” morality asks us to value pointless self-denial. It’s a subtle Enlightenment broadside against overly strict religious moral codes. Hume’s preferred virtues are the “cheerful” ones – generosity, moderation (not total abstinence), compassion, wit, good humor. A virtuous person in Hume’s eyes is *well-adjusted, kind, sociable, and prudent* – not an otherworldly ascetic. This is morality for humans, not for imagined angels.

The impact of the *Enquiry concerning Morals* was quieter than that of the first *Enquiry*, perhaps because it was less controversial on the surface. It affirmed widely held notions (kindness is good, cruelty bad) but gave them a new philosophical foundation. Over time, this work has been recognized as a founding document of what would become **moral sentimentalism** and even utilitarian thought. Hume didn’t reduce virtue to raw utility the way Bentham later would – he always spoke of sentiment and pleasure, not just calculation of benefit – but the idea that *usefulness to society* is a measure of virtue certainly paved the way for consequentialist ethics. Adam Smith, Hume’s friend, would take inspiration from Hume’s idea of sympathy as the basis of moral judgment. In Hume’s own oeuvre, the second *Enquiry* represents the capstone of his positive philosophy – a complement to the skepticism of the first *Enquiry*. Together, they show Hume’s two sides: the keen critic of human reasoning’s pretensions, and the warm observer of human moral sentiments. As we proceed, we will see Hume apply this same naturalistic, empirical lens to other domains – notably religion and history – continuing to follow the arc of his thought through the 1750s and beyond.

## *Political Discourses* (1752)

While Hume was polishing his moral philosophy, he was also deeply engaged with issues of political economy and public life. In 1752 he published a set of essays under the title *Political Discourses*, which would later be incorporated into his collected *Essays and Treatises*. These Discourses solidified Hume’s reputation as an insightful commentator on commerce, finance, and government – earning praise across Europe (in fact, they were quickly translated into French and brought Hume some fame in France). Though not a single treatise, the *Political Discourses* collectively form a significant part of Hume’s philosophical output, showcasing his empirical method applied to the **nascent science of economics and politics**. Hume’s core themes here are consistent with his general philosophy: trust experience over theory, observe human nature, and seek general rules that have practical verification. In these essays, he argues against mercantilist misconceptions, champions free trade, analyzes the roots of political power, and considers questions of demography and public credit with a clear-eyed skepticism of dogma. The style remains that of an urbane essayist – crisp, accessible, and rich with examples from history.

One might wonder: what is philosophical about essays on money or trade? But in Hume’s time, **economics and political science were emerging disciplines**, and Hume approached them in the same empirical spirit he did psychology or ethics. He believed there are general causes and effects in politics that careful reasoning can uncover – albeit not with certainty, but with *probability*. As he wrote in one discourse, *“It is a question with several, whether there be any *essential difference* between one form of government and another?… But though this question, perhaps, cannot be fully answered, yet we may receive light from it, by examining the *principles* on which government is founded”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=All%20people%20of%20shallow%20thought,sure%20to%20happen%2C%20that%20will)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=particular%20affair%2C%20and%20forms%20schemes,General)). Hume then proceeds to examine *opinion* as the basis of all authority (people obey rulers because they have certain opinions – of interest, fear, duty, etc. – that support obedience). This is a classic Hume move: reduce grand political power to the sum of individuals’ beliefs and passions. **Even in politics, it’s human nature at work.**

A standout essay is **“Of Commerce.”** Hume takes on the then-dominant mercantilist view that hoarding gold and limiting imports makes a nation strong. Contrarily, Hume posits that *industry, productivity, and open trade* are the true sources of wealth and power. In modern terms, he’s arguing for economic liberalism: let people pursue their economic self-interest, allow the specialization of labor and trade between nations, and all will benefit. Hume contends that **wealth is not zero-sum** – one nation’s gain needn’t be another’s loss. *“The world is so connected that it is impossible any nation should prosper by their neighbors’ ruin,”* he writes (anticipating Montesquieu and Adam Smith). One of Hume’s key contributions here is the idea of the *flow of money and prices* – often called the “specie-flow mechanism.” In the essay “Of Money,” he observes that increasing the money supply (say, by a gold discovery) will boost industry only temporarily; ultimately, prices will rise proportionally and neutralize the effect. This insight undermined mercantilists’ obsession with accumulating gold – Hume shows that money is just a medium, and real wealth lies in goods and labor. *“*Money* is not, properly speaking, one of the subjects of commerce; but only the *instrument* which men have agreed upon to facilitate the exchange of one commodity for another,”* he explains, clearing conceptual confusion ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=presumption%20of%20falsehood%2C%20and%20where,be%20just%3B%20and%20that%20the)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=particular%20affair%2C%20and%20forms%20schemes,General)). He also famously describes how an influx of money can stimulate output until prices catch up, noting there’s a lag where people are motivated by higher demand before they realize overall prices have risen. This was a rudimentary version of what later economics calls the non-neutrality of money in the short run.

In “Of the Balance of Trade,” Hume further demolishes the notion that a constant positive trade balance is needed. He imagines events like large money flows between countries and shows that they tend to self-correct through price adjustments. If one country has less money, its goods become cheaper, so it will export more and money will flow back – a natural equilibration ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=The%20same%20method%20of%20reasoning,It%20is%2C%20therefore)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=convert%20what%20share%20of%20it,And%20the)). This is essentially the price-specie-flow mechanism later formalized by economists: Hume discovered it intuitively.

Beyond economics, the *Political Discourses* include **political theory** proper. In “Of the Origin of Government” (also known as “Of the First Principles of Government”), Hume argues that government arises not from an explicit social contract (as Locke or Rousseau might say), but from more basic principles of human nature: our need for security and order, habits of obedience, and the slow growth of authority through utility. **“Force is always on the side of the governed,”** Hume observes – since the governed are many and governors few – so in the long run it’s **opinion** that sustains governments ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=All%20people%20of%20shallow%20thought,sure%20to%20happen%2C%20that%20will)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=presumption%20of%20falsehood%2C%20and%20where,be%20just%3B%20and%20that%20the)). Be it opinion of divine right, opinion of the advantage of a particular constitution, or simply the habit of obedience, **public opinion is the real cement**. Here Hume prefigures modern political science: recognizing “legitimacy” (though he doesn’t use the word) as key to stability.

In “Of the Protestant Succession,” Hume wades into then-sensitive English politics, coolly analyzing why the Hanoverian (Protestant) succession in Britain is politically expedient compared to a return of the Catholic Stuarts. Hume himself was no anti-Catholic bigot – in fact he was sometimes accused of Jacobite sympathies – but he dispassionately argues that the Protestant establishment is more likely to maintain Britain’s liberty and prosperity, because a Catholic absolute monarchy (like France’s) would be less tolerant and less conducive to commerce. His arguments again rest on utility, not divine sanction: the best government is one that **secures property, encourages industry, and avoids the extremes of tyranny or civil war**.

Throughout these discourses, Hume’s **skeptical method** is in play. He routinely questions received wisdom by checking it against experience. In “Of Public Credit,” for example, he examines the practice of governments accumulating debt. Many believed national debt could be endlessly increased. Hume worries that excessive debt might lead to national bankruptcy or burden the economy, yet he also notes how public credit (debt) can stimulate commerce by injecting money during peacetime. He strikes a balanced view: some debt can be managed, but its growth must eventually be checked – a prescient caution given later centuries’ debt crises.

One particularly intriguing discourse is **“Of the Populousness of Ancient Nations.”** Here Hume does a pioneering study in what we now call demography. He sifts through evidence and arguments on whether the ancient world had more people than modern Europe. Hume concludes that ancient populations were likely smaller than often claimed, debunking glib assertions of massive numbers in classical armies and cities. But more broadly, he shows a critical use of evidence – parsing biases in sources and thinking probabilistically. While this essay can be very detailed (discussing grain production and land usage in antiquity, for instance), it underscores Hume’s commitment to **fact-based inquiry** over romantic conjecture.

Philosophically, what emerges from the *Political Discourses* is a coherent liberal (in the 18th-century sense) worldview: one that values **liberty, moderation, industry, and the rule of law**, and distrusts **fanaticism, zealotry, and absolute power**. Hume repeatedly highlights how **extremes in politics are self-defeating**. In “That Politics may be reduced to a Science,” he asserts that while human affairs won’t ever have the certainty of maths, we can observe tendencies – e.g., absolute monarchies tend toward corruption, popular governments toward faction, etc. – and thus derive *general maxims*. One such maxim, implicit in Hume’s essays, is that **freedom and prosperity go hand in hand**. He notes, for instance, that countries with free governments (like Britain) encourage commerce and innovation, whereas despotic regimes (like Turkey or China, as he saw them) stagnate despite stability ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=particular%20affair%2C%20and%20forms%20schemes,nor%20is%20it%20easy%20for)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=But%20when%20we%20reason%20upon,Every%20judgment%20or%20conclusion%2C%20with)). This connection between liberty and economic progress becomes a cornerstone of Enlightenment thinking, and Hume was among its clearest exponents.

Stylistically, the discourses are polished. Hume often begins an essay with a broad division of “shallow thinkers” vs “abstruse thinkers,” gently positioning himself as the happy medium who pursues refined thought but stays connected to common sense ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=T%20HE%20greater%20part%20of,we%20can%20learn%20from%20every)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=All%20people%20of%20shallow%20thought,sure%20to%20happen%2C%20that%20will)). For instance, opening “Of Commerce,” he wryly notes: *“The greater part of mankind may be divided into two classes: that of shallow thinkers, who fall short of the truth; and that of abstruse thinkers, who go beyond it”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=T%20HE%20greater%20part%20of,we%20can%20learn%20from%20every)). He of course aims to avoid both errors. This charming introduction leads into serious analysis, but it shows Hume’s knack for engaging the reader with a light touch before getting technical.

One can also see how the *Political Discourses* complement his moral philosophy. The virtues he praised in the *Enquiry* – benevolence, justice, allegiance – play out on the larger stage of society. Commerce becomes, in Hume’s view, a civilizing force: *“Commerce, arts, manufacture, and industry, occupy the lower classes of people, and prevent the _disorders_ which commonly arise from idleness and want”*, he writes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=martial%20a%20genius%2C%20and%20such,but%20the%20provisions%20flow%20in)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=industry%2C%20and%20support%20the%20community,individuals%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the)). Luxury (often condemned by earlier moralists) is defended by Hume as something that can *“animate [men] with a spirit of avarice and industry”*, which actually strengthens society by increasing its resources ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=affections%20,is%20still%20supported%3B%20and%20the)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=industry%2C%20and%20support%20the%20community,individuals%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the)). This ties into his moral stance that what matters is usefulness and happiness: if so-called “luxury” (nice clothes, fine houses, etc.) motivates people to work harder and be inventive, then it isn’t vice – it’s a *public benefit*. Hume flips the classical notion that luxury is decay; for him, **luxury can be a source of progress**, as long as it remains under the guidance of industry and public interest ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=the%20exigencies%20of%20state%2C%20may%2C,these%20principles%20are%20too%20disinterested)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/pld/co#:~:text=industry%2C%20and%20support%20the%20community,individuals%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the)).

In sum, *Political Discourses* shows Hume applying his empirical-skeptical lens to society at large. He dissects economic fallacies, argues for policies based on human nature’s propensities, and foresees the direction of modern capitalist economies. Along with contemporary thinkers like Montesquieu, Hume helped lay the intellectual groundwork for **classical liberalism** – advocating constitutional government, free trade, religious toleration (implicitly, by critiquing superstition in politics), and gradual reform grounded in experience. His conclusions always circle back to the *human element*: trade works because humans are naturally ambitious and seek comfort; government must harness, not thwart, such natural passions.

The importance of these essays was recognized in Hume’s time. They boosted his fame more than the philosophical treatises did. When combined in later editions of *Essays, Moral and Political*, they made Hume one of the leading voices of the Scottish Enlightenment on practical affairs. They demonstrate that the same mind which pondered the depths of causality could also calculate the price of corn in Rome or the effect of a tax on interest rates. For Hume, there was continuity in this: in every domain, **understanding is improved by facts, critical inquiry, and the avoidance of dogmatic extremes**. This is the Humean method in action, yielding tangible lessons for governance and economics.

Having examined Hume’s thoughts on mind, morals, and politics, we turn now to his forays into the philosophy of religion – a topic where his skepticism meets one of its greatest challenges. In the mid-1750s, Hume composed works on religion that would only partly see the light during his life, given the sensitivities involved. It’s to those works – *The Natural History of Religion* and the posthumously published *Dialogues concerning Natural Religion* – that we now turn, to see how Hume’s empirical approach tackled the most transcendental subject of all.

## *The Natural History of Religion* (1757)

In 1757, Hume published *The Natural History of Religion*, a brief but bold treatise that applies the experimental method to religion as a human phenomenon. Unlike his other works on religion (the *Dialogues* were still kept private), *Natural History* does not debate God’s existence or nature directly. Instead, it asks a different question: **How did religious belief arise and evolve in human history and psychology?** Hume sets aside theological truth-claims and looks at religion the way a naturalist might look at an ecosystem – as something to be explained by human fears, hopes, and imagination. This approach was unusual, even impious, for its time. But Hume carefully couches it as a neutral inquiry, even paying lip service in the introduction to the reasonableness of basic theism ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=A%20S%20every%20enquiry%2C%20which,question%2C%20concerning%20the%20origin%20of)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=most%20obvious%2C%20at%20least%2C%20the,nations%20have%20been%20discovered%2C%20who)). Once into the analysis, however, Hume articulates a striking thesis: **the first religions were polytheistic and anthropomorphic**, born from human anxiety and ignorance, and only later did monotheism arise, often bringing its own set of corruptions. Throughout, Hume maintains a tone of cool observation, yet a thread of irony and criticism of popular religion runs just below the surface.

Hume begins the *Natural History* by drawing a crucial distinction between two questions: *What is the foundation of religion in reason?* vs. *What is the origin of religion in human nature?* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=A%20S%20every%20enquiry%2C%20which,question%2C%20concerning%20the%20origin%20of)). He asserts the first question is actually easier: the observable order of nature leads many to infer an intelligent Creator (this is basically the design argument, which Hume – at least in this work – says no reasonable person can reject in general) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=concerning%20its%20foundation%20in%20reason%2C,has%20neither%20perhaps%20been%20so)). But the second question – how actual religious practices and ideas started among humans – is more complex. Hume notes that people in different times and places have believed wildly different things about gods. So, religion is not an original instinct (like hunger or lust) which is uniform; rather it’s a secondary, derived phenomenon that takes diverse forms ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=religion%20in%20human%20nature%2C%20is,impression%20of%20nature%2C%20such%20as)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=credited%3B%20and%20no%20two%20nations%2C,cases%2C%20may%2C%20by%20an%20extraordinary)). Thus, to explain it, Hume will look at psychological causes.

His overarching narrative is as follows: In early, unenlightened times, humans faced a scary and uncertain world. They didn’t understand nature’s causes. *“We are placed in a world, where the **true springs and causes of every event are entirely concealed from us**,”* Hume writes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=N%203)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=We%20are%20placed%20in%20this,in%20perpetual%20alarm%20by%20an)). Life’s fortunes – good or ill – seem to come from invisible powers. Ignorant of natural science, people’s imaginations anthropomorphize these unknown causes. The result? **Polytheism** – belief in multiple limited gods governing different aspects of life. As Hume succinctly puts it, *“Polytheism or idolatry was, and necessarily must have been, the first and most ancient religion of mankind”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=Sect,the%20primary%20Religion%20of%20Men)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=It%20appears%20to%20me%2C%20that%2C,confirm%20by%20the%20following%20arguments)). Why “necessarily”? Because the way the human mind works under ignorance is to project human qualities outward. Hume describes how even in trivial things we “find human faces in the moon, armies in the clouds” and attribute purpose to everything that affects us ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=There%20is%20an%20universal%20tendency,belief%2C%20they%20may%20serve%2C%20at)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=There%20is%20an%20universal%20tendency,And%20though%20these)). It’s a *natural propensity* to assume that whatever causes our pleasure or pain has intentions. Thus storms, earthquakes, disease – these must be somebody’s doing. Unable to discern a single orderly plan, early humans imagined many little agents behind the myriad events, *“every part of nature [having] a sovereign director”* in their eyes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20matter%20of,opposed%20to%20so%20full%20an)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20matter%20of,opposed%20to%20so%20full%20an)).

Hume breaks down further **the psychological drives** behind primitive religion: *hope and fear*. In Section II-III, he argues that it’s the anxious uncertainty of outcomes that leads humans to personify causes and then try to placate or bribe those supposed beings. *“The mind of man is subject to certain unaccountable terrors and apprehensions,”* he says, especially when events seem random ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=These%20two%20species%20of%20false,As%20these%20enemies%20are%20entirely)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=unaccountable%20terrors%20and%20apprehensions%2C%20proceeding,consist%20in%20ceremonies%2C%20observances%2C%20mortifications)). *“Where real objects of terror are wanting, the soul… finds imaginary ones,”* conjuring specters and powers to be afraid of ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=These%20two%20species%20of%20false,As%20these%20enemies%20are%20entirely)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/emp/se#:~:text=unaccountable%20terrors%20and%20apprehensions%2C%20proceeding,consist%20in%20ceremonies%2C%20observances%2C%20mortifications)). At the same time, when people are fortunate or high-spirited, they may indulge in **enthusiastic** fancies of being favorites of a god (though Hume associates that more with monotheistic fervor – in polytheism, each domain has its god, but one might think one has personal tutelary spirits). 

One key point Hume makes is that **polytheism is a very natural state of belief** – it matches how the world appears: lots of unconnected forces, requiring local appeasements. He cites evidence: ancient histories show polytheism everywhere; even in his contemporary world, many distant cultures (he mentions some newly discovered tribes, etc.) have polytheistic or animistic practices ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20matter%20of,opposed%20to%20so%20full%20an)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=the%20theism%2C%20and%20that%20too,opposed%20to%20so%20full%20an)). He dryly notes that a few philosophers (like some ancients) developed a purer theism, but they were rare, and popular religion remained polytheistic. 

Hume then traces how **monotheism** likely emerged from polytheism. Section IV-VII argue that gradually people might elevate one god as supreme or primordial among the many (perhaps due to philosophical reflection or the growth of large states needing a patron deity). But Hume is not laudatory of this development. In fact, he does something quite daring: he compares the moral and social effects of polytheism vs. theism, and finds polytheism in some ways *more tolerant and benign*. 

For example, in Section IX “Comparison of these Religions, with regard to Persecution and Toleration,” Hume observes that **polytheists were generally tolerant**: since they accept many gods, they easily incorporate others’ deities. *“[Polytheism] naturally admits the gods of other sects and nations… rendering all the various deities compatible with each other,”* he notes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=Polytheism%20or%20idolatrous%20worship%2C%20being,is%20opposite%20both%20in%20its)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=religious%20systems%20of%20mankind,from%20religious%20worship%2C%20and%20set)). A Roman could worship Hercules and Isis and still respect Celtic or Persian gods – there’s no exclusive truth. The downside of polytheism, Hume says, is that because it’s based on vulgar traditions, it can authorize barbaric practices (like weird sacrifices), and it’s prone to priestly manipulation ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=Polytheism%20or%20idolatrous%20worship%2C%20being,is%20opposite%20both%20in%20its)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=Polytheism%20or%20idolatrous%20worship%2C%20being,well%20as%20rites%2C%20ceremonies%2C%20or)). But it’s not fanatical: *“Idolatry [polytheism] is attended with this evident advantage, that by limiting the powers and functions of its deities, it naturally admits the gods of other sects”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=barbarous%20or%20corrupted%2C%20may%20be,is%20opposite%20both%20in%20its)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=religious%20systems%20of%20mankind,from%20religious%20worship%2C%20and%20set)). 

Monotheism, on the other hand, has the theoretical advantage of ascribing perfection to the single deity – so if done right, it could lead to a purer, more rational religion. However, Hume argues that in practice monotheism brought about **intolerance and speculative dogmatism**. *“As that system supposes one sole deity… it naturally requires the unity of faith and ceremonies, and furnishes [zealots] a pretence for representing their adversaries as profane,”* Hume writes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=advantages%20and%20disadvantages,of%20object%20seems%20naturally%20to)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=balanced%20,and%20as%20no%20one%20can)). If there’s one true God and one right way, differences become heresies. So monotheists have persecuted each other incessantly. Hume also slyly points out that while theism aspires to a perfect God, popular monotheism tends to *anthropomorphize* God anyway with human passions (jealousy, anger at idolaters, etc.), sometimes making the monotheistic God as morally questionable as any pagan god. *“Theism is an improvement in some ways over polytheism,”* he grants, *“but these mighty advantages are… somewhat diminished by inconveniences.”* Those inconveniences include precisely the intolerance and fanaticism he describes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=advantages%20and%20disadvantages,of%20object%20seems%20naturally%20to)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=balanced%20,pleased%20with%20different%20and%20opposite)). He even suggests monotheism led to more morose religious practices in some cases – because if one infinite God demands exclusive worship, the worshipper feels more guilt and fear of disapproval. Polytheists, by contrast, could always turn to another god if one failed them, or bargain around. 

Hume’s treatment of **religion’s moral effects** is unsparing in Section X-XIV. In Section X, “With regard to courage or abasement,” he argues polytheists were more jovial and courageous, while monotheists (especially in their ascetic forms) often encourage abject submission and self-mortification. In Section XI, “With regard to reason or absurdity,” he essentially says: look, neither polytheists nor common monotheists really use reason much in religion; both have believed absurd things – many popular monotheistic doctrines (mysteries of faith, etc.) are as irrational as any pagan myth. The difference is perhaps philosophers under monotheism tried to square religion with reason (giving natural theology), whereas polytheism never claimed to be rational. 

Section XII, “With regard to doubt or conviction,” contrasts the easy-going attitude of polytheists (who don’t fuss if you don’t accept Mercury, you might favor Apollo more, that’s fine) with the firm conviction demanded by monotheists (one must *believe* and have faith – doubt becomes sin). Monotheism’s emphasis on belief leads to internal struggles (people force themselves to quell doubt) and external aggression (enforcing orthodoxy on others). 

Section XIII, “Impious conceptions of the divine nature in both kinds,” is where Hume really lowers the boom: he says, basically, *neither popular polytheism nor popular theism has room to brag about depicting God(s) worthily*. Polytheism openly portrays gods with vices and follies (Zeus’s adulteries, etc.), which is obviously “impious” in the sense of attributing moral corruption to the divine. Monotheism avoids overtly saying God is imperfect, yet Hume points out that popular monotheists still often, through their doctrines, ascribe to God *cruel or absurd attributes*. For example, he likely has in mind doctrines of hell (infinite punishment – what does that say about God’s mercy?) or the idea that God favors one tribe or sect exclusively (making God partisan or egoistic). Indeed, he specifically calls out how the God of popular theism is depicted as jealous, punitive, partial – *“a wicked and foolish man”* except more powerful ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=it,their%20future%20fortune%2C%20should%20immediately)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=frailty%3B%20but%20have%20oft%20ascribed,powers%2C%20possessed%20of%20sentiment%20and)). This might refer to episodes in the Old Testament or similar. Hume’s scathing line: *“Transferring, as is too usual, human passions to the deity, [people] represent him as jealous and revengeful, capricious and partial… No wonder, then, that mankind, being placed in such absolute ignorance of causes… should immediately acknowledge a dependence on invisible powers”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=it,their%20future%20fortune%2C%20should%20immediately)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=frailty%3B%20but%20have%20oft%20ascribed,powers%2C%20possessed%20of%20sentiment%20and)). In short, both systems end up with rather unedifying portrayals of the divine – polytheism anthropomorphizes too crudely; monotheism attempts a perfect being but popular imagination drags it down to anthropomorphic tyranny.

Finally, Section XIV “Bad influence of popular religions on morality” drives home Hume’s secular stance: often religion hasn’t improved morals at all; sometimes it made them worse. He notes how religious devotees might think piety (ritual, zeal) can compensate for moral defects, leading them to commit injustices “for the sake of religion.” Superstitious people might value useless observances over genuine virtue. Or religious disputes cause people to hate others while thinking themselves virtuous for it. Hume doesn’t deny that some individuals may be morally elevated by their faith – but he suggests it’s not a clear net positive at the societal level. Virtue often thrives *in spite of* the distortions of superstition or enthusiasm. 

After this tour de force analysis, the final Section XV is a “General Corollary” where Hume, somewhat wryly, sums up that if one weighed all this, one might lean to think *“the corruptions and infamy of polytheism”* are worse, but on second thought, *“the consequences of theism, when carried to the utmost, are no less pernicious”*, though in different ways ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=Polytheism%20or%20idolatrous%20worship%2C%20being,is%20opposite%20both%20in%20its)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=barbarous%20or%20corrupted%2C%20may%20be,if%20justly%20prosecuted%2C%20banish%20every)). He diplomatically doesn’t state an outright preference, but the reader can sense Hume’s implication: enlightened monotheism shorn of superstition (a philosophical theism) could be best, *if* it remained tolerant and reasonable – but actual historical monotheism often hasn’t lived up to that, while polytheism had the merit of tolerance but was mired in ignorance. Neither delivered an ideal moral religion.

The *Natural History of Religion* basically pioneered what we now call the anthropology or psychology of religion. Hume treats religion as a natural human creation and doesn’t resort to saying any revelation or supernatural guidance shaped it. He explains prayer, sacrifice, divination as attempts to curry favor with unseen powers out of fear ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=themselves%2C%20and%20to%20transfer%20to,imagination%2C%20without%20which%20they%20could)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=human%20faces%20in%20the%20moon%2C,god%20or%20hamadryad%20always%20taken)). He interprets the rise of monotheism as partly a product of generalizing from an array of gods to one (some scholars think he was inspired by reports of how certain ancient cultures evolved, or possibly by the idea that Judaism started monotheistic reform in a previously polytheistic world). But he also clearly has an anti-clerical and anti-fanatical agenda: to show that *religion is not the mother of all virtue; rather, it has very human origins and has wrought both good and ill*. The wise should understand this natural history to keep religion in check – using reason and perhaps channeling the positive while mitigating the negative (this conclusion he doesn’t state explicitly here, but that seems to be his purpose).

Reception-wise, Hume published *Natural History* with some other essays (like “Of the Passions”) as *Four Dissertations*. It was somewhat overshadowed by controversy around another essay “Of the Immortality of the Soul” which he wisely withdrew from that collection. But *Natural History* did garner a critical pamphlet from clergyman Richard Hurd, which Hume mentions in *My Own Life*: Dr. Hurd’s response was “full of illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrility,” Hume says, taking some satisfaction that he at least provoked a reaction ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%20this%20interval%2C%20I%20published,indifferent%20reception%20of%20my%20performance)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%20this%20interval%2C%20I%20published,indifferent%20reception%20of%20my%20performance)). That indicates how daring this work was: Hurd attacked it vehemently, sensing perhaps the subversive implications. Hume did not reply (he avoided religious controversy overtly, to keep his reputation within bounds), but *Natural History* quietly planted seeds that later thinkers would cultivate – the idea that religion can be studied like any cultural artifact and explained without recourse to divine intervention.

Thus, by 1757, Hume had systematically addressed human nature in nearly all dimensions: knowledge (*Enquiry #1*), ethics (*Enquiry #2*), politics and economics (*Discourses*), and now religion (*Natural History*). Each time, he peered beyond surface claims (whether of rationalist philosophers, moralists, mercantilists, or theologians) and looked for the **empirical reality** of the matter – custom and habit in knowledge, sentiment in morals, self-interest and opinion in politics, fear and imagination in religion. What remained for him was to bring his philosophy full circle, including addressing directly the arguments for God’s existence and nature that he had temporarily shelved in *Natural History*. That he did in his final philosophical work – the *Dialogues concerning Natural Religion*. But before we explore those, we should note that Hume’s attention in the 1760s turned to a massive project of a different kind – a narrative of factual human events – his monumental *History of England*. We will consider the *History* briefly after the *Dialogues* and *My Own Life*, as it represents the culmination of Hume’s efforts to analyze human nature in action, on the grand canvas of history.

## *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* (1779, posthumous) 

If the *Natural History of Religion* dissected religion’s origins, the *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* go to the heart of the philosophical debate about God. Written in dialogue form – after the model of classical works like Plato’s or Cicero’s – this is Hume’s most polished literary effort, and his most dramatic philosophical presentation. Hume worked on the *Dialogues* for many years (letters show he had drafts by the mid-1750s), but, knowing their explosive content, he never published them in his lifetime. Only in 1779, three years after his death, did they appear, as per his final instructions. The *Dialogues* feature three characters: **Cleanthes**, who advocates an empiricist **theism** (believing that the order of the world clearly proves an intelligent Designer, and we can understand God by analogy to human mind); **Demea**, who represents a fideist or **mystical orthodoxy** (believing God’s nature is entirely beyond human comprehension, known only through faith and revelation, and emphasizing God’s infinity and our feebleness); and **Philo**, a skeptic (arguably voicing Hume’s own viewpoint), who pokes holes in Cleanthes’ reasoning and leans towards a very limited or mitigated theism verging on agnosticism. The genius of the dialogue form is that Hume doesn’t directly say “God doesn’t exist” – he never does, in fact. Rather, he has Philo raise devastating critiques of the popular arguments, while leaving the ultimate conclusion somewhat ambiguous. By the end, Philo even professes a sort of concession: that a minimal deity (a first cause with some remote analogy to human intelligence) might be admitted. Yet this “God” is so far from the providential, anthropomorphic deity of traditional religion that the concession feels more like a tongue-in-cheek capitulation. The *Dialogues* thus allow Hume to have his cake and eat it: to dismantle the argument from design and other theological reasoning with wit and rigor, but to do so within a playful conversation that diffuses direct blame (after all, *characters* are speaking, not necessarily the author) and ends on a note that could be read as not entirely atheistic.

The central debate of the *Dialogues* revolves around the **Argument from Design**. Cleanthes, in Part II, lays it out in a classic formulation: *“Look around the world: contemplate the whole and every part of it; you will find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines… all these various machines… are adjusted to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly… *the productions of human contrivance*… **Since, therefore, the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the **Author of Nature** is somewhat similar to the mind of man, though possessed of much larger faculties**”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=and%20every%20part%20of%20it%3A,their%20most%20minute%20parts%2C%20are)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=as%20in%20a%20machine%20of,causes%2C%20therefore%2C%20must%20be%20resembling)). This is the empirical theist’s key claim: the world is like a giant machine, so just as a machine implies a designer with a mind, the world implies a supreme mind. Cleanthes puts it forcefully, saying this inference is so obvious that only someone “refractory” would resist. Importantly, Cleanthes’ approach is **empiricist** – he doesn’t invoke innate ideas or a priori proofs; he relies on analogy and observation, which is presumably Hume’s preferred method. Thus Hume chose the strongest form of the design argument, one appealing to his own epistemological values.

Enter Philo with the rebuttals. Across many parts (especially II, V, VI, VIII), Philo picks apart the analogy and its implications:

- **Weak Analogy**: Philo argues that the analogy between the universe and human artifacts (like a house or watch) is very imperfect. We have experience of houses being built by designers, but we have *no* experience of worlds being made. The two cases are not closely parallel. *“The exact similarity of the cases gives us a perfect assurance of a similar event,”* Philo concedes in general ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20analogy%20in%20each%20step,or%20reason%20from%20the%20great)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20analogy%20in%20each%20step,or%20reason%20from%20the%20great)). But here the similarity is small and the steps in the argument are huge: *“The world *resembles* a human artifact, therefore it *is* one, therefore it arose from design.”* Philo jokes that by similar (flawed) logic, one might say: “This world is a very *imperfect* production, like an ill-made ship; ergo, perhaps it’s the work of an *inferior* deity – a child deity, or an old deity who has since died” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=machine%3F%20And%20what%20surprise%20must,worlds%20might%20have%20been%20botched)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=machine%3F%20And%20what%20surprise%20must,worlds%20might%20have%20been%20botched)). He even introduces alternative analogies: Why not say the world is more like an **animal or a plant** than a machine? In Part VII, Philo suggests an *“vegetative”* hypothesis – that perhaps the world grows from a seed or something, as plants do. After all, plants and animals reproduce themselves and have an order, and the world *“plainly resembles an animal or a vegetable”*, with cycles, generations, etc., arguably more than it resembles a watch ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=that%20there%20are%20other%20parts,The%20world%20plainly)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=that%20there%20are%20other%20parts,The%20world%20plainly)). If so, the cause of the world might be something more like reproduction than design – maybe an eternal succession of worlds begetting worlds. This is deliberately fantastical, but it serves to show that *many analogies are possible*; choosing the design analogy is somewhat arbitrary.

- **Infinite Regression / Who Designed God?**: If complexity requires a designer, then God’s mind, being complex (more perfect than ours, as Cleanthes holds), would seem to require a designer too. Philo notes that attributing order to a mind doesn’t really solve the problem because that mind is another complex order. Cleanthes might respond God’s mind is unique or self-explanatory, but that weakens the empirical argument which demanded causes similar to their effects.

- **Problem of Evil**: In Part X and XI (the famous **Epicurean questions** passage), Philo unleashes the **problem of suffering** as a way to question the nature of the supposed designer. If the world’s cause is like a human mind, we should infer something about its moral character from the world’s mixture of good and evil. And clearly, the world is filled with misery as well as happiness. Philo enumerates all the ills living creatures suffer – pain, natural disasters, the fragility of life, the “inaccurate workmanship of all the springs and principles of nature” that causes disease and decay ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=You%20ascribe%2C%20Cleanthes%2C%20,At)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=You%20ascribe%2C%20Cleanthes%2C%20,At)). The result: if we reason strictly analogically, we cannot conclude the designer is all-powerful *and* benevolent. Either he’s willing to prevent evil but not able (impotent) or able but not willing (malevolent), or neither (then why call him God?), as the ancient philosopher Epicurus framed it ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=Epicurus%27s%20old%20questions%20are%20yet,willing%3F%20whence%20then%20is%20evil)). This doesn’t disprove a designer, but it seriously challenges orthodox theism (which claims God’s omnipotence and goodness). Cleanthes concedes this point is troublesome – in fact, Cleanthes earlier says (Part VI) that experience of the world doesn’t actually support God’s infinite attributes, only some very great but finite power. So even Cleanthes quietly steps back: the design argument, if valid, might show a designer of great intelligence and power, but *not* necessarily infinite or perfect, and possibly not morally perfect either.

- **We Know Too Little**: Philo often returns to our position of ignorance. We have a sample size of one universe; we’ve never seen how universes are made. So any conclusion is conjectural. He also notes (Part II) that for all we know, matter itself could have some ordering principle – he hints at an alternate hypothesis that maybe the world’s order could arise naturally (what we’d think of now as perhaps laws of physics, though Hume doesn’t have modern physics ideas – he’s more thinking like some ancient atomists who thought random motion of matter could by chance form stable arrangements).

- **Multiplicity of Deities**: Another hit – Cleanthes imagines one author of nature; but in human projects, often many people cooperate (a ship is built by a whole crew of artisans). Why not polytheism as the inference? Perhaps several gods designed the world collaboratively ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=machine%3F%20And%20what%20surprise%20must,worlds%20might%20have%20been%20botched)). Cleanthes can’t rule that out by argument from analogy.

Throughout, Hume’s Philo uses Cleanthes’ own empiricist standards to undercut him: you base your argument on experience and analogy – fine, but push it fully and it doesn’t yield the comfortable theism you want.

Demea, meanwhile, plays a different role – he keeps insisting that God’s nature is beyond comprehension and we should not reason about it but accept it on faith (also he voices the **cosmological argument** briefly, claiming there must be a necessarily existent being to ground everything contingent). Demea in the end gets fed up and leaves the conversation after Philo vividly describes how miserable life is (Demea, being pious, had contended earlier that the world is miserable to make us yearn for God – an Augustinian type stance – but Hume has Philo and Cleanthes twist that into essentially atheistic conclusions, which horrifies Demea). So Demea might represent religious dogmatism that gives up on rational inquiry; he doesn’t fare well in the dialog, as both Cleanthes and Philo refute him at times. One might see Hume disposing of the *a priori* proof (Demea’s cosmological argument) by Cleanthes’ retort: we have no idea of “necessary existence” – any being we can conceive not existing, so the term is meaningless to us ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L116%20of%20an,and%20none%20but%20a%20mind)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20an%20ancient%2C%20,and%20none%20but%20a%20mind)). Demea’s position collapses or withdraws, leaving the field to the empiricist theist vs. empiricist skeptic debate (which is Hume’s real focus).

By the final part (Part XII), Philo has clearly gotten the better of Cleanthes on most points. Cleanthes basically has been pushed to say: *perhaps* the cause of the world is something analogous to the human mind, but obviously much different in degree (and presumably in other unknown ways). At this point, Philo surprisingly “changes face” and delivers what seems to be a concession speech. He admits that the order of the universe likely *does* have some intelligent cause: *“A purpose, an intention, a design strikes everywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker; and no man can be so hardened… as at all times to reject it”*. *“That the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of art is evident,”* he says ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=nature%2C%20and%20consequently%20is%20merely,and%20apparent%20sympathy%20in%20all)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=if%20he%20does%20not%20allow%2C,every%20age%3B%20whether%20the%20rotting)). He then tells Cleanthes, suppose a nominal atheist acknowledges that “the original principle of order in the universe *bears some remote analogy to human intelligence*,” wouldn’t the dispute be over? Cleanthes eagerly agrees ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=the%20parts%20of%20this%20world%2C,then%2C%20cry%20I%20to%20both)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=impossible%20he%20can%20deny%20it%3A,Will%20you)). Philo goes on: well, then, we’ve established that much – some *great* (though perhaps incomprehensible) mind is behind nature – and the Theist and (former) Atheist can shake hands, as their remaining difference (how similar is the divine mind to ours?) is mere degree, a verbal dispute ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=probable%2C%20that%20the%20principle%20which,of%20any%20determination%3F%20If%20you)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=operations%20of%20Nature%2C%20and%20among,hand%20exaggerates%20the%20dissimilarity%20between)). 

This reads almost like Philo (Hume) saying: *I’m not denying there is a designer, I’m just saying we can’t comprehend it well, and the evidence doesn’t warrant the full theistic picture.* In fact, Philo then continues to undermine the idea that we can ascribe moral attributes to God given the mixture of good and evil (reiterating that the “moral qualities” of the deity must remain mysterious or at least very different from human virtue) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=of%20our%20benevolence%20and%20justice%3B,11)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=attributes%20of%20the%20Deity%20have,11)). The concluding lines have Philo stating: “These, Cleanthes, are my unfeigned sentiments on this subject” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=D%2012)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=D%2012)), and Cleanthes praising Philo for his noble spirit of controversy and saying if Philo’s skepticism leads him to such a fairly benign outlook (a sort of minimal deism), Cleanthes has little left to object to.

Readers have long debated this ending. Some think Hume meant it ironically – that Philo’s “concession” is tongue-in-cheek or simply a strategic retreat to a position that hardly differs from agnosticism. After all, admitting a “remote analogy” between the world cause and intelligence doesn’t commit one to worship, prayer, an afterlife, or any distinctive religious doctrine. It’s basically saying: the universe might have some kind of mind behind it, but we know nothing about it beyond what we see in nature (which is flawed and finite). This is very close to *deism*, but even more minimal (most deists still thought God is benevolent and gave a moral law; Philo/Hume isn’t granting that). It also aligns with what Hume had intimated in *Natural History*: that the rational kernel of religion (the easy part) is believing some designing intelligence exists; but everything beyond that (specific theology) is conjecture or imagination. So Hume’s personal stance might well be that a vague deistic God is the *most* one can support by reason – and even that not with certainty, just as a plausible inference – and that this God is far from the providential one. 

Interestingly, *My Own Life* notes that the *Dialogues* “somewhat moderate” the more radical implications of *Natural History*, suggesting that Hume felt the *Dialogues* ended up with a more conciliatory or at least ambivalent result than *Natural History* did ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%20this%20interval%2C%20I%20published,indifferent%20reception%20of%20my%20performance)). Indeed, *Natural History* starkly highlighted religion’s ill effects, whereas *Dialogues* don’t talk about morality or social effects much – they stick to natural theology arguments. So arguably, *Dialogues* are less incendiary. 

Nevertheless, the core achievement of the *Dialogues* is to have, in extremely elegant form, exposed the *limits of natural theology*. After reading them, even if one still believes in a creator, one would have to admit that reason alone doesn’t straightforwardly lead to the Christian God or any richly characterized deity. It leads at best to an unknown cause somewhat like reason – which is a far cry from the object of traditional religious devotion. Kant, one of Hume’s great successors, credited *Hume’s Dialogues* (and *Enquiry*) with awakening him. Later, figures like Darwin and others would wrestle anew with the argument from design in light of actual natural explanations (evolution). In a way, Hume prefigured that: he didn’t have evolution, but he sowed seeds of doubt about the uniqueness of design. Perhaps nature has its own principles of order (today we’d say natural selection or physical laws) – Hume’s suggestions of self-organizing principles (like the vegetable analogy) hint at naturalistic alternatives.

By crafting the debate in a literary dialogue, Hume also made this work engaging and accessible beyond the philosophical circles. The characters have distinct voices: Cleanthes is the sensible moderate believer, Demea the dour mystic, Philo the witty skeptic. Their banter – sometimes serious, sometimes light – is enjoyable to read, full of subtle irony. It’s easily one of the best philosophical dialogues in English. Hume even meta-reflects in the intro (Pamphilus’s letter) on why dialogues are a fitting method for such an obscure subject as God: when questions are so uncertain that “reasonable men may differ,” a dialogue, which shows a debate with no final resolution, is apt ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=D%200)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/d/full#:~:text=Any%20question%20of%20philosophy%2C%20on,human%20life%2C%20study%20and%20society)). That is exactly his conclusion: the *Dialogues* end without a clear winner. Each reader must judge. Of course, it’s stacked enough that most unbiased readers feel Philo carried the day.

When *Dialogues* finally published in 1779, it did create a stir, though Hume was safely beyond worldly caring. Its arguments have since become staples: the problem of evil, the weakness of analogical arguments, the difficulty of inferring infinite attributes from finite effects – all are now classic points in philosophy of religion, largely thanks to Hume’s masterful articulation here.

With the *Dialogues*, Hume’s philosophical project essentially came to a close. He had started by questioning human knowledge in the *Treatise*, and he ended by questioning what many consider the highest object of knowledge (God). In between, he charted morality, society, and history using the same principles. 

Before concluding our journey through Hume’s works, it’s worth addressing two final writings that illuminate Hume himself as a person: his mammoth *History of England* and his brief autobiography *My Own Life*. The *History*, though more historical than philosophical, demonstrates Hume putting into practice his ideas about human nature and society on a grand scale – it was also by far his most commercially successful work, making him famous as a historian. *My Own Life*, written just before his death, shows Hume in a candid light, reflecting on his career with the same clarity and modesty that mark his philosophy. We will touch on these to round out the portrait of Hume’s mind and legacy.

## *My Own Life* (1776)

David Hume’s final published piece was not a philosophical treatise at all, but a brief autobiography titled *“My Own Life.”* He composed it in April 1776, as he faced a painful terminal illness at age 65. It was published shortly after his death (as a preface to an edition of his works). In just a few pages, Hume manages to review his entire life’s work and quietly demonstrate the character that had enabled his philosophy. *My Own Life* is written in Hume’s trademark clear style, tinged with gentle humor and a touch of pride kept in check by irony. It reveals Hume as a man of letters who met triumph and disappointment with equanimity, and who – true to his Epicurean-skeptical leanings – approached death with remarkable calm and cheerfulness.

One striking thing about *My Own Life* is Hume’s honesty about failure. He famously begins the account of his literary career by recalling the disaster of his beloved first book: *“Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my **Treatise of Human Nature**. It fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots.”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Never%20literary%20attempt%20was%20more,neglected%20in%20my%20early%20youth)). This line shows Hume’s wry wit – “dead-born” and “not even a murmur among zealots” (meaning it was so ignored even critics didn’t bother attacking it). But Hume doesn’t wallow; he says he was naturally cheerful and soon resumed study with great ardor ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Never%20literary%20attempt%20was%20more,neglected%20in%20my%20early%20youth)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=excite%20a%20murmur%20among%20the,neglected%20in%20my%20early%20youth)). It gives a sense of the robust temperament behind his skepticism: he could doubt everything in theory, yet personally remain “cheerful and sanguine.”

He then recounts how his next work, the *Essays, Moral and Political* (1741-42), “was favorably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=sanguine%20temper%2C%20I%20very%20soon,neglected%20in%20my%20early%20youth)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=my%20studies%20in%20the%20country,neglected%20in%20my%20early%20youth)). We see Hume’s pragmatism: he recognized that the *Treatise* was perhaps ill-timed or ill-expressed (elsewhere he laments he published too early, “went to the press too early” at age 26 ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20had%20always%20entertained%20a,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20had%20always%20entertained%20a,Enquiry%2C%20while%20my%20performance%20was))). So he adapted, writing more accessible essays – and it paid off. Yet even then, Hume notes the *Enquiry concerning Human Understanding* (1748), his rewrite of the *Treatise*’s first part, also “*was at first little more successful*” than the original ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20had%20always%20entertained%20a,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=early,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)). He arrived in England to find the intellectual world ablaze over someone else’s work (Middleton’s *Free Enquiry* on miracles), while his own had been “entirely overlooked” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=concerning%20Human%20Understanding%2C%20which%20was,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=this%20piece%20was%20at%20first,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)). Likewise, a new edition of his *Essays* in London “met not with a much better reception” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Nature,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=a%20ferment%20on%20account%20of,with%20a%20much%20better%20reception)). It’s clear Hume’s road to recognition was slow and uneven.

What’s impressive is Hume’s lack of bitterness. *“Such is the force of natural temper,”* he writes, *“that these disappointments made little or no impression on me.”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Such%20is%20the%20force%20of,gradually%20increasing%2C%20and%20that%20new)). Instead of sulking, he retreated to the countryside (in 1749) and wrote more – specifically, the *Political Discourses* and the *Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals* (which he calls “another part of my Treatise cast anew”) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Such%20is%20the%20force%20of,gradually%20increasing%2C%20and%20that%20new)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=his%20country,gradually%20increasing%2C%20and%20that%20new)). He also mentions that by the early 1750s, his works were finally gaining traction: conversation in good company, sales rising, and notable clergymen writing refutations (Bishop Warburton’s scathing attack being a sign of honor, in a way, as it showed Hume’s ideas were being noticed) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=publications%20,me%20encouragement%2C%20as%20I%20was)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=editions%20were%20demanded,to%20an%20estate%20of%20ten)). This part of *My Own Life* gives an insightful behind-the-scenes of the Enlightenment literary scene: an author tracking his sales and the “answers” published to his works. Hume resolved *never to reply* to critics – *“I have easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles,”* he notes with pride ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=editions%20were%20demanded,me%20encouragement%2C%20as%20I%20was)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=beginning%20to%20be%20esteemed%20in,me%20encouragement%2C%20as%20I%20was)). That restraint reflected his philosophical values of calm and moderation.

Hume then recounts his success: by 1752 his *Political Discourses* had an immediate success (“the only work of mine that was successful on the first publication” he says ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%201751%2C%20I%20removed%20from,and%20unobserved%20into%20the%20world)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Discourses%2C%20the%20only%20work%20of,and%20unobserved%20into%20the%20world))), and that same year his *Enquiry concerning Morals* appeared “which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, *incomparably the best*” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=It%20was%20well%20received%20abroad,and%20unobserved%20into%20the%20world)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=London%2C%20my%20Enquiry%20concerning%20the,and%20unobserved%20into%20the%20world)). This famous self-assessment shows Hume’s modesty (not wanting to self-judge) yet clear preference for his moral philosophy. Interestingly, he admits *Enquiry of Morals* *“came unnoticed and unobserved into the world.”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=London%2C%20my%20Enquiry%20concerning%20the,and%20unobserved%20into%20the%20world)). So even what he thought his best was underappreciated at the time.

Perhaps the greatest turn in Hume’s fortunes came with his *History of England*, a project begun around 1754. *My Own Life* recounts this with drama. He had become librarian to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh, which gave him access to a large library and the idea to write a comprehensive history ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%201752%2C%20the%20Faculty%20of,the%20subject%20was%20suited%20to)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20received%20little%20or%20no,But%20miserable%20was%20my)). He started ambitiously with the reigns of the Stuart kings (1600s). But the first volume (published 1754, covering James I and Charles I) was **greeted with a “cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even detestation” from all factions** ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=thought%2C%20the%20misrepresentations%20of%20faction,and)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=every%20capacity%2C%20I%20expected%20proportional,five%20copies%20of%20it.%20I)). Hume had sympathized a bit with the royalist side (casting a “generous tear” for Charles I, executed in the Civil War), which enraged Whigs; yet he was no Tory either, which annoyed the Jacobites. Essentially, as he puts it, “Whig, Tory, churchman and sectary, freethinker and religionist, patriot and courtier, united in their rage against the man who had presumed to shed a generous tear for Charles I and the Earl of Strafford” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=was%20the%20only%20historian%2C%20that,Mr)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=disappointment%3A%20I%20was%20assailed%20by,only%20except%20the%20primate%20of)). This hyperbolic description shows Hume’s surprise at how universally hated his first volume was. And after the initial fury, worse yet, it “seemed to sink into oblivion” – in a year only 45 copies sold! ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=the%20man%2C%20who%20had%20presumed,me%20messages%20not%20to%20be)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=what%20was%20still%20more%20mortifying%2C,me%20messages%20not%20to%20be)). Hume quips he scarcely heard of any man of letters who could “endure” the book, except two archbishops who kindly sent messages of approval (amusingly, the only supporters were high clergy, one in England and one in Ireland) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=the%20man%2C%20who%20had%20presumed,me%20messages%20not%20to%20be)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=what%20was%20still%20more%20mortifying%2C,me%20messages%20not%20to%20be)).

Hume confesses this blow “discouraged” him, and had war with France not intervened making a retreat to France impossible, he might have left Britain forever under an alias ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20was%2C%20however%2C%20I%20confess%2C,up%20courage%20and%20to%20persevere)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20was%2C%20however%2C%20I%20confess%2C,up%20courage%20and%20to%20persevere)). But stuck in Britain, and with Volume II already in progress, he persevered. By 1756, Volume II (covering from the Civil War through the Glorious Revolution of 1688) appeared, and it “gave less displeasure to the Whigs” and even buoyed up the unfortunate first volume a bit ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%201756%2C%20two%20years%20after,buoy%20up%20its%20unfortunate%20brother)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%201756%2C%20two%20years%20after,buoy%20up%20its%20unfortunate%20brother)). He recounts how, despite learning the lesson that the Whigs effectively controlled literary success (through patronage etc.), he nonetheless stuck to his guns and even made “a hundred alterations” in the Stuart volumes “invariably to the Tory side” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=But%20though%20I%20had%20been,a%20regular%20plan%20of%20liberty)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=But%20though%20I%20had%20been,a%20regular%20plan%20of%20liberty)). He wasn’t going to flatter prevailing prejudices. Hume calls it ridiculous to treat pre-1688 England as a model of liberty – implicitly, he saw the Tory view of history (that the Stuarts weren’t so tyrannical as Whigs painted them) as more accurate in many respects ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=But%20though%20I%20had%20been,a%20regular%20plan%20of%20liberty)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=so%20little%20inclined%20to%20yield,a%20regular%20plan%20of%20liberty)). His determination and thick-skinned confidence is palpable.

Volumes on the Tudor dynasty (published 1759) met renewed “clamour” (particularly the Reformation under Elizabeth offended many Protestants for his sympathetic touches toward Catholics) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%201759%2C%20I%20published%20my,tolerable%2C%20and%20but%20tolerable%20success)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%201759%2C%20I%20published%20my,tolerable%2C%20and%20but%20tolerable%20success)). But by the final two volumes (1761) covering earlier history up to Henry VII, things had settled: they met “tolerable success” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%201759%2C%20I%20published%20my,tolerable%2C%20and%20but%20tolerable%20success)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=callous%20against%20the%20impressions%20of,tolerable%2C%20and%20but%20tolerable%20success)). Then Hume notes something crucial: despite “variety of winds and seasons” in reception, the *History* eventually brought him wealth. The booksellers paid him more for the *History* than anyone had been paid in England for a history, he says ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=But%2C%20notwithstanding%20this%20variety%20of,with%20whom%20I%20was%20not)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=But%2C%20notwithstanding%20this%20variety%20of,now%20turned%20of%20fifty%2C%20I)), and he “was become not only independent, but opulent.” In other words, by 1762 Hume achieved financial security and, indeed, celebrity primarily thanks to the *History of England*, which soon became the standard work on the subject for many decades. 

He retired to Edinburgh with a comfortable income of £1000 a year (a very solid fortune) at just over 50 years old, vowing never to leave again ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=But%2C%20notwithstanding%20this%20variety%20of,with%20whom%20I%20was%20not)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=of%20Scotland%2C%20determined%20never%20more,offer%2C%20however%20inviting%2C%20I%20at)). But fate had more for him: in 1763, he was invited to accompany Lord Hertford to Paris as an embassy secretary. In *My Own Life*, Hume describes at length his reluctant acceptance and then the astonishing reception he got in Paris society ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=MOL%2018%2C%20Mil%20xxxix)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20not%20seen,of%20settling%20there%20for%20life)). *“Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes will never imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks and stations,”* he writes, bemused by how his fame as a philosopher made him lionized in the French salons ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20not%20seen,of%20settling%20there%20for%20life)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20not%20seen,of%20settling%20there%20for%20life)). *“The more I recoiled from their excessive civilities, the more I was loaded with them,”* he says ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20not%20seen,of%20settling%20there%20for%20life)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=reception%20I%20met%20with%20at,of%20settling%20there%20for%20life)). This shows Hume’s modesty and perhaps a bit of satisfaction – in Catholic France, ironically, he was treated like a sage, whereas in Protestant Britain he’d had such a struggle for recognition. He confesses real enjoyment in Paris due to the “great number of sensible, knowing, and polite company” – he even thought of settling there for life ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=Those%20who%20have%20not%20seen,of%20settling%20there%20for%20life)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=more%20I%20recoiled%20from%20their,of%20settling%20there%20for%20life)).

Hume’s time in Paris is also famous for his friendship with Diderot, d’Holbach, and the French philosophes, and the amusing “affair” of him bringing Jean-Jacques Rousseau back to Britain which ended in a bizarre falling-out (not mentioned in *My Own Life*, likely too much detail). In 1765 he left Paris wealthier (Hertford got him a pension) and became Under-Secretary of State in London briefly, returning to Edinburgh in 1769, “very opulent… healthy, and though somewhat stricken in years, with the prospect of enjoying long my ease and seeing the increase of my reputation” ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=I%20was%20appointed%20secretary%20to,an%20invitation%20to%20be%20Under)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=same%20view%20as%20formerly%2C%20of,revenue%20of%201000%20pounds%20a)). It was in these final Edinburgh years that Hume welcomed the young Adam Smith and others, and quietly oversaw publication of the *Dialogues* (posthumously through Smith). 

The most moving part of *My Own Life* is Hume’s description of his illness and attitude toward death. In spring 1775 he got a “disorder in my bowels” that he realized was mortal ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%20spring%201775%2C%20I%20was,most%20choose%20to%20pass%20over)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=In%20spring%201775%2C%20I%20was,a%20few%20years%20of%20infirmities)). He calmly states he expects a speedy dissolution but notes *“I have suffered very little pain… and more strange, have never suffered a moment’s abatement of my spirits. *So much so* that were I to name a period of my life which I should choose to re-live, I might be tempted to point to this last period.”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=me%20no%20alarm%2C%20but%20has,reputation%27s%20breaking%20out%20at%20last)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=now%20reckon%20upon%20a%20speedy,It)). This is a remarkable testament to Hume’s serenity. He says he still has the same ardor for study and “gaiety in company” as ever, and philosophically views death as cutting off only a few years of infirmities ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=disorder%3B%20and%20what%20is%20more,than%20I%20am%20at%20present)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=my%20person%2C%20never%20suffered%20a,than%20I%20am%20at%20present)). He also acknowledges seeing signs that his literary reputation is about to shine even more brightly, but notes he could only have a few years to enjoy it anyway. *“It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present,”* he concludes ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=ardour%20as%20ever%20in%20study%2C,than%20I%20am%20at%20present)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=that%20a%20man%20of%20sixty,than%20I%20am%20at%20present)). This line could almost serve as his epitaph.

Indeed, Hume’s friend Adam Smith later wrote a touching letter (published later) describing Hume in his final months, playing whist, joking about Charon the ferryman of Hades, and facing death with complete composure. *My Own Life* corroborates that image: Hume essentially died as he lived – reasonably, good-humoredly, without either faith or fear in the face of the unknown. 

He ends the autobiography with a short character sketch of himself. He writes in the third person: *“I was… a man of mild disposition, of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my passions.”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=To%20conclude%20historically%20with%20my,had%20no%20reason%20to%20be)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=To%20conclude%20historically%20with%20my,had%20no%20reason%20to%20be)). He notes even his love of literary fame, his “ruling passion,” never soured his temper despite frequent disappointments ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=speak%20my%20sentiments,a%20word%2C%20though%20most%20men)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=little%20susceptible%20of%20enmity%2C%20and,a%20word%2C%20though%20most%20men)). He enjoyed both the company of the young and frivolous and the learned and studious, and particularly liked the company of modest women (with whom he says he was never unsuccessful – a gentle brag) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=little%20susceptible%20of%20enmity%2C%20and,to%20be%20disarmed%20in%20my)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=notwithstanding%20my%20frequent%20disappointments,to%20be%20disarmed%20in%20my)). Perhaps most telling: *“Though most men anywise eminent have found reason to complain of calumny, *I never was touched or even attacked by her baleful tooth*.”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=notwithstanding%20my%20frequent%20disappointments,the%20zealots%2C%20we%20may%20well)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=particular%20pleasure%20in%20the%20company,the%20zealots%2C%20we%20may%20well)). Despite exposing himself to the “rage of both civil and religious factions,” he says, “they seemed disarmed” of their usual fury in his case ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=particular%20pleasure%20in%20the%20company,they%20thought%20would%20wear%20the)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=the%20rage%20of%20both%20civil,this%20is%20a%20matter%20of)). Why? Possibly because Hume was personally so amiable that even those who disliked his opinions couldn’t hate the man. He reports that zealots would have loved to spread a scandal about him, but *“they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability.”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=the%20rage%20of%20both%20civil,this%20is%20a%20matter%20of)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=the%20rage%20of%20both%20civil,this%20is%20a%20matter%20of)). The subtext is that Hume’s life was irreproachable: he gave no ammunition by any immoral conduct. He calls this little self-eulogy perhaps vain, but “I hope not misplaced,” since it can be factually checked ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=circumstance%20of%20my%20character%20and,is%20easily%20cleared%20and%20ascertained)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/mol#:~:text=disadvantage%2C%20but%20they%20could%20never,is%20easily%20cleared%20and%20ascertained)). 

Thus, in *My Own Life*, Hume effectively offers himself as Exhibit A of his philosophy’s viability. Here was a man who let go of dogmas and faced reality, and as a result lived **happily, virtuously, and with intellectual riches**. He even avoided the pitfall some skeptics fall into – bitterness or misanthropy – remaining, by his account, benevolent and beloved. In the context of his works, it’s as if Hume is saying: *Judge my philosophy by its fruits – it made this kind of life possible.* In a sense, his cheerfulness in the face of mortality is the practical culmination of his thought: he achieved the “mitigated skepticism” he championed, which counsels involvement in common life and enjoyment of simple pleasures, while keeping a sense of perspective about the limits of human understanding. Many have remarked that Hume’s personal virtue and calm rival that of the most saintly religious figures – except with Hume, it came from humanistic philosophy. 

In finishing *My Own Life*, the reader is left with an image of Hume not just as an abstract thinker, but as a humane individual: curious, sociable, modest yet confident. It’s a fitting final note to the symphony of his works. We see the unity between the content of Hume’s thought and the conduct of his life – both exemplify **moderation, empirical grounding, open-mindedness, and a sense of humanity**. 

# Conclusion

David Hume’s intellectual journey, traced through his major works in order of publication, reveals a mind relentlessly committed to understanding *human nature on its own terms*. From the audacious *Treatise of Human Nature* in his twenties, through the refined *Enquiries*, the worldly *Essays and Discourses*, the contemplative *Natural History of Religion*, and the incisive *Dialogues*, up to his reflective *My Own Life*, Hume consistently applied an “experimental method” to the mind, morals, politics, and religion. He looked at evidence – whether the operations of thought, the feelings that underlie virtue, the dynamics of commerce and power, or the origins of belief in unseen powers – and drew conclusions guided not by what *we wish* were true, but by what the weight of experience indicates. 

Several grand themes recur: **empiricism**, the doctrine that all our ideas stem from experience and that we should proportion belief to evidence, suffuses everything. It leads Hume to be skeptical of rationalist pretensions (be they metaphysical dogmas or theological “proofs”), yet it also guides him to positive insights – that habit underlies our sense of causation, that sympathy undergirds our morals, that commerce and liberty flourish together, that religions grow out of human hopes and fears. **Skepticism**, in Hume’s hands, is not a dead-end cynicism but a tool to prune away unfounded claims. He uses it to show the limits of reason – we cannot *demonstrate* matters of fact or God’s nature – but this very realization then directs us to where our surest grounds lie: in common life, natural feelings, and observable relations. Hume’s skepticism is always **mitigated by common sense**. When he pushes doubt to its extreme (as in the Treatise’s famous despair), he “cures” it by returning to backgammon and good company. Thus he advocates a balanced philosophy that accepts both our intellectual limitations and the natural patterns (customs, instincts) that enable us to live and think effectively despite those limitations.

Another unifying thread is **naturalism**. Hume continuously endeavors to explain phenomena (mind, morality, religion) without recourse to supernatural or mysterious faculties. The understanding is not guided by a special rational intuition of necessary connections – it’s driven by custom. Moral distinctions are not perceived by a mystical Reason – they are felt via a moral sentiment. Nations do not rise and fall solely by Providence or great-man virtue – Hume’s *History* shows they are pushed by human passions, economic forces, and sometimes sheer accident (though we did not detail the *History*, it strongly reflects his belief in secular causes and general tendencies over heroic or providential narratives). Religion itself, Hume holds, can be dissected as a natural phenomenon emerging from psychological needs. In all these, Hume essentially seeks the *earthly causes* of things often attributed to heaven.

Crucially, none of this naturalism leads Hume to nihilism or despair about value. On the contrary, he extols **humanity, benevolence, friendship, moderate enjoyment, and the pursuit of knowledge** as the real goods. By organizing morality around utility and agreeableness, he grounds ethics in what actually benefits people – cutting through moral fanaticism to a shared core of human decency. By praising commerce and learning, he points to practical ways society improves. By analyzing fanaticism and superstition, he implicitly commends tolerance and reasonableness in religion. And by describing his own contentment and virtuous character in *My Own Life*, he shows that a life without religious certainty or metaphysical absolutism can nonetheless be rich in meaning, virtue, and happiness.

There is also a theme of **humility and reform**. Hume repeatedly took something grand (say, causality, or God’s governance) and showed it to be both less and more than we thought: less certain or perfect than philosophers claimed, yet more interesting in how it truly operates. For instance, cause and effect turn out not to be guaranteed by reason – but learning that they are based on habit teaches us something profound about the mind’s way of navigating the world, and it encourages a humble scientific attitude (keep observing and updating beliefs, since nothing is certain a priori). Likewise, we cannot prove God’s goodness or existence definitively – but seeing the weakness of those proofs might curb superstition’s excesses and direct religious sentiment to a more philosophical, tolerant stance (this was arguably Hume’s hope: a purified deism or at least a tempering of dogma). Hume’s corrections often come with a positive flipside: debunking false certainty in metaphysics leaves us the firmer ground of empirical science; debunking moral rationalism leaves us with a grounding of ethics in human feeling and social utility, which arguably resonates more with our lived moral experience and can foster consensus. 

In writing style, as we observed, Hume’s prose evolved to become a model of elegant English. The early *Treatise* was dense and scholarly (though still lucid in parts), but the later essays and enquiries are masterpieces of clear argument and apt illustration. He pioneered the conversational yet incisive tone that characterizes much Enlightenment writing. It’s no wonder that by the end of his life he was recognized not just as a great thinker, but also as a great writer. His balanced, polite voice allowed his radical ideas to be heard where a more abrasive style might have been rejected.

Hume’s influence on subsequent thought can hardly be overstated. Philosophers from Kant to Darwin to Einstein, economists and psychologists, historians and theologians – all have engaged with Hume’s legacy. But perhaps his greatest legacy is the example of intellectual integrity and courage combined with personal amiability. Here was a man who doubted what nearly everyone around him devoutly believed – the powers of reason to find eternal truths, the divine governance of the world, the absolute authority of moral rules – yet he did so without arrogance, without malice, and without losing his own moral compass or zest for life. In Hume, philosophy is not an ivory tower game; it is an attempt to genuinely understand how humans think, feel, believe, and behave. And that understanding, he believed, can make us wiser and better.

We can imagine Hume, in his final days, “detached from life” yet savoring a good-natured conversation or a book of Tacitus, exemplifying the very perspective he had long argued for: a thoughtful enjoyment of the here and now, accepting the mysteries that remain. The arc of his works shows him widening his circle – from the solitary reflections of the *Treatise*, through engagement with pressing social and religious topics, to the self-reflection of his autobiography where the philosopher becomes fully aware of his place in the human story. 

In the end, Hume achieved what he proposed in the introduction to the first *Enquiry*: a philosophy that is “easy and obvious” enough to relate to ordinary life, yet “accurate and abstruse” enough to satisfy the seeker of truth ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=The%20other%20species%20of%20philosophers,and%20deformity%2C%20without%20being%20able)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=The%20other%20species%20of%20philosophers,While%20they%20attempt%20this%20arduous)). He painted virtue in amiable colours, unmasked error with eloquence rather than rancor, and directed our curiosity to those “original principles” by which, in every science, human inquiry is bounded ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=literature%2C%20that%20philosophy%20should%20not,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=literature%2C%20that%20philosophy%20should%20not,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)). As we close this journey through Hume’s works, we have, in effect, watched him “reduce politics to a science,” put morality on an experimental footing, trace religion to human roots, and even turn the mirror on himself – all with a spirit of sincere inquiry and civil discourse. Reading Hume sequentially is thus not just an exercise in intellectual history; it is to witness the unfolding of an 18th-century mind devoted to illuminating “the secret springs and principles” of human nature ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=We%20are%20placed%20in%20this,imagination%20is%20equally%20employed%20in)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/n/full#:~:text=We%20are%20placed%20in%20this,become%20the%20constant%20object%20of)). And in doing so, Hume has indeed *“contributed to the instruction of posterity”* ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=literature%2C%20that%20philosophy%20should%20not,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)) ([Hume Texts Online](https://davidhume.org/texts/e/full#:~:text=task%2C%20they%20are%20deterred%20by,abstract%2C%20and%20even%20unintelligible%20to)), leaving us a legacy of ideas and a model of reasoned, humane thought that remain vitally relevant in our own time.
