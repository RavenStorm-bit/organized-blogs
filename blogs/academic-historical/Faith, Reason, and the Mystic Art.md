Perfect. I’ll begin digging deep into the full body of Ramon Llull’s major works—extracting his original themes, methods, and ideas straight from the source, treating each book seriously and quoting heavily where possible. I’ll break the essay into chapters that develop thematically (not just summaries), and I’ll rely on academic sources and primary English translations. Sit tight—I’ll be back with an epic, longform essay worthy of the margins of The New Yorker and the spirit of Llull himself.

# Ramon Llull’s Quest for Truth: Faith, Reason, and the Mystic Art

**By [Your Name]**

## The Art of Finding Truth – Llull’s Divine Logic

 ([Ars demonstrativa | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/ars-demonstrativa)) *Figure 1: One of Llull’s circular figures (Figure A) from the *Ars demonstrativa*, illustrating the interconnections of the divine attributes. In this combinatorial diagram, each lettered sector represents a *dignity* of God (goodness, greatness, eternity, power, wisdom, will (or love), virtue, truth, glory, perfection, justice, generosity, simplicity, nobility, mercy, lordship), and the lines connect every attribute to every other. Llull’s mystical logic assumed that because all these attributes coexist and interrelate perfectly in God, one can, by systematic combination, discover truths about creation and the divine. ([Ars demonstrativa | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/ars-demonstrativa#:~:text=Figure%20A%C2%A0represents%20God%20and%20sixteen,generosity%2C%20simplicity%2C%20nobility%2C%20mercy%2C%20lordship)) ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=audience,to%20a%20special%20arboreal%20symbolism))* 

Ramon Llull began with an audacious premise: that the eternal truths of Christianity could be demonstrated by reason, through a universal “Art” of logical combination. In 1274, after a life-changing mystical vision on Mount Randa, the young Mallorcan courtier-turned-hermit set out to devise what he called the *Ars inveniendi veritatem* – literally, “The Art of Finding Truth” ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=Passion%20to%20discover%20or%20invent,sought%20by%20Llull%20consist%20of)). This was no mere scholarly exercise. Llull envisioned a method by which the core doctrines of faith – the Trinity, the Incarnation, the attributes of God – could be proven with *necessary reasons* so compelling that no “infidel” could deny them ([
Ramon Llull (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/llull/#:~:text=match%20at%20L461%20as%20Rubio,practice%20the%20principles%20of%20faith)). In his first Ars (also known as the *Ars compendiosa*), written in Latin so that it might persuade learned Jews and Muslims, he developed a system of symbolic figures and letters representing divine principles. By rotating and combining these symbols according to set rules, one could generate all possible propositions about God and creation, then test their truth. The goal was boldly evangelistic: equip missionaries and debaters to “convert the infidels through the necessary reasons stated throughout the text” ([
Ramon Llull (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/llull/#:~:text=match%20at%20L461%20as%20Rubio,practice%20the%20principles%20of%20faith)), and strengthen Christians in understanding the rational structure of their own faith.

Llull’s *Art* was *amorous* as well as *rigorous*, to use his own terms ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=Passion%20to%20discover%20or%20invent,sought%20by%20Llull%20consist%20of)). He believed God had created the world with a fundamentally rational order that mirrors His own triune nature, an order accessible to human minds enlightened by love. Thus, the *Ars* begins with a set of basic divine attributes (goodness, greatness, eternity, etc.) and relational principles (difference, concordance, contrariety, beginning, middle, end, etc.), each assigned a letter. In the full form of the Art, intricate circular diagrams (such as *Figure A* above) show these letters in every possible configuration, like a cosmic logic wheel ([Ars demonstrativa | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/ars-demonstrativa#:~:text=The%C2%A0Ars%20demonstrativa%C2%A0contains%2012%20%E2%80%98primary%E2%80%99%20figures%2C,of%20the%20concepts%20in%20question)) ([Ars demonstrativa | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/ars-demonstrativa#:~:text=Image%3A%20fugura_v_def)). By following Llull’s prescribed rotations and combinations, the user generates statements – for example, *“Goodness concords with Wisdom”* or *“Mercy is contrary to Justice”*. Each statement can then be examined for truth in light of Christian doctrine. In Llull’s optimistic vision, this method would lay bare the underlying harmony of all knowledge. Every branch of study, every philosophical question, could be mapped onto the same set of divine principles. The *Art* was thus intended as a universal key: “general for all sciences,” as Llull writes in the introduction to his *New Astronomy* ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,fail%20more%20often%20than%20not)), and capable of unlocking arguments in theology, philosophy, natural science or ethics. And because its first principles were the attributes of the one true God, it would inevitably vindicate the Catholic faith when used correctly.

There is a charming naiveté in Llull’s confidence that a single logical tool could resolve all disputes. But we must not mistake his intent: this was not cold rationalism, but an intellectual *ministry*. Llull often prayed before writing, and he grounded each logical figure in fervent contemplation of God’s nature. The result was a peculiar fusion of scholastic method and mystical insight – a “theology by geometry” carried out in the spirit of love. In the *Ars demonstrativa* (1283), a later refinement of his system, Llull reduced the number of symbols and made the figures more workable ([Ars demonstrativa | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/ars-demonstrativa#:~:text=This%20work%20was%20the%20second,combinatorial%20mechanisms%20and%20the%20calculations)) ([Ars demonstrativa | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/ars-demonstrativa#:~:text=The%C2%A0Ars%20demonstrativa%C2%A0contains%2012%20%E2%80%98primary%E2%80%99%20figures%2C,of%20the%20concepts%20in%20question)), hoping to convince the skeptical academics at the University of Paris. He describes in that work how every element of reality reflects this fundamental set of principles. Everything that exists has, in a manner of speaking, God’s fingerprints all over it. As one modern commentator summarizes, Llull’s Art was meant “to reach necessary conclusions” and be truly “general, because it encompasses both real and logical objects” ([
Ramon Llull (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/llull/#:~:text=match%20at%20L798%20find%20those,thus%20applicable%20to%20any%20topic)). By binding reason and faith in an unbreakable chain, Llull sought to silence the perennial quarrel between philosophy and theology. Instead of “either reason or faith,” Llull’s motto might well have been *fides quaerens intellectum* – faith seeking understanding – elevated to a grand combinatorial enterprise.

If all this sounds abstract, Llull was quick to demonstrate the Art in action. He composed many works to showcase his method (often by actually incorporating the figures into the text). Perhaps the most poignant illustration of his intentions comes from an episode in his dialogue *The Book of the Gentile*, where a non-believer is on the verge of choosing a religion. Llull pointedly has the wise Christian debater refuse to coerce the decision; instead, the three monotheistic sages prefer to step aside and let reason take its course: 

> “And all the more so since this is a question we could discuss among ourselves to see, by force of reason and by means of our intellects, which religion it must be that you will choose. And if, in front of us, you state which religion it is that you prefer, then we would not have such a good subject of discussion nor such satisfaction in discovering the truth.” ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Gentile_and_the_Three_Wise_Men#:~:text=%3E%20,301%29%5B%202))

Here the *infidel* Gentile is given full freedom, and the climax of the story is notably open-ended. Llull does **not** force a dramatic conversion to Christianity within the tale. Instead, he ends on a subtle note: the Gentile privately “asserts that he knows which is the good religion,” but the reader is not told his choice ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/book-gentile-and-three-wise-men#:~:text=knowledge%20of%20faith%20through%20the,which%20is%20the%20good%20religion)). The genius of this ending is how it models Llull’s ideal of conversion – one born from interior discovery, not external pressure. The wise men’s courteous dialogue follows the “conditions” of Llull’s Art, using combinations of attributes (goodness with greatness, justice with mercy, etc.) to compare doctrines ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/book-gentile-and-three-wise-men#:~:text=The%C2%A0Book%20of%20the%20Gentile%20and,of%20Christianity%20would%20come%20about)). The Christian’s hope, of course, is that truth’s inherent harmony will lead the Gentile to Christ. Yet by leaving the decision untold, Llull as author practices what he preaches: trust in reason illuminated by grace. This approach was virtually unique among medieval polemicists. Llull’s knowledge of Judaism and Islam was *responsable et adéquate*, as one scholar noted, “not very common in writers of religious polemic at this time” ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/book-gentile-and-three-wise-men#:~:text=Two%20things%20draw%20one%E2%80%99s%20attention,truths%20which%20all)). He respectfully lays out the tenets of Moses and Muhammad alongside those of Christ, convinced that honest inquiry will reveal Christianity’s superior coherence. It is a quietly radical scene – a *disputation* without a victor, save reason itself.

## A Meeting of Faiths in the Woods – *The Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men*

In the year 1276, Ramon Llull penned a little dialogue that stands as one of the first works of comparative religion in medieval Europe. *The Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men* is framed as a chance encounter in a beautiful wilderness: a Gentile (a pagan philosopher) wanders into a forest and finds three men, a Jew, a Christian, and a Muslim, conversing by a flowing fountain. The setting is idyllic – “descriptions of a wondrous, idealised nature” suffuse the tale ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/book-gentile-and-three-wise-men#:~:text=The%C2%A0Book%20of%20the%20Gentile%C2%A0is%20written,outbursts%20of%20lofty%20religious%20poetry)) – and it serves as neutral ground for what follows: a remarkably civil debate on God and salvation. Each of the three wise men, in turn, presents the essential beliefs of his faith to the Gentile, who listens intently to all. Llull uses this simple plot to achieve a complex goal. On one level, the book is an apologetic for Christianity; the Christian sage naturally offers the most convincing case, and the narrative subtly inclines toward him. But Llull does not allow an outright triumph. Instead, he lets the dialogue end with the polite stalemate quoted above. The “Gentile” thanks his new friends and slips away to make his choice in private. The reader, left in suspense, is invited to carry on the reasoning process personally – an ingenious narrative move that extends the debate beyond the pages of the book.

Llull’s handling of this interfaith dialogue reveals much about his character. He was a devout Christian on fire to convert the world, yet he was also a man who had imbibed the spirit of the troubadours and the courtesies of courtly love. In *The Book of the Gentile* the tone is “highly emotive” but unfailingly courteous ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/book-gentile-and-three-wise-men#:~:text=The%C2%A0Book%20of%20the%20Gentile%C2%A0is%20written,outbursts%20of%20lofty%20religious%20poetry)). The wise men address each other as respectful adversaries; there are no insults hurled, no authorities quoted that the others do not recognize. This was intentional. Llull believed that for the Art to work, the debate must follow certain *ludic* rules – he calls them the “conditions of the flowers which grew on five symbolic trees” ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/book-gentile-and-three-wise-men#:~:text=The%C2%A0Book%20of%20the%20Gentile%20and,of%20Christianity%20would%20come%20about)) – essentially, rules of engagement ensuring fairness and rationality. All parties had to agree on some common principles (for instance, that God exists, that God is good, just, etc. – which the three monotheists do) and then proceed by logical combinations of those principles. Under these conditions, Llull was sure, “the incontrovertible triumph of Christianity would come about automatically, without the participants feeling belittled or threatened…the victory of reason” ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/book-gentile-and-three-wise-men#:~:text=men%20of%20good%20faith%20who,It%20was%C2%A0the%20victory%20of%20reason)). In the forest debate, we see this optimistic theory put into practice. The trio of theologians share arguments about the unity of God, the creation of the world, the reality of the soul, and the resurrection of the dead – all foundational points on which they actually agree ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/book-gentile-and-three-wise-men#:~:text=of%C2%A0Islam%2C%20with%20a%20responsible%20and,Seemingly%2C%20therefore%2C%20the)). Only after establishing common ground do they venture to differ, each expounding the particular “Articles of Faith” of his religion ([Ramon Llull - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull#:~:text=earliest%20and%20most%20well,about%20the%20Lullian%20method%20when)). The Muslim sage extols the prophethood of Muhammad; the Jew explains the Law of Moses; the Christian preaches Christ crucified and risen. The Gentile, having no prior commitment, weighs each case with an air of detached wonder.

Throughout this exchange, Llull’s own voice emerges in the compassionate wisdom of the Christian speaker. At one poignant moment, one of the wise men notes that most people cling to the faith of their birth and that disputation seldom succeeds in changing them ([Catholic Ethics 1250-1350 by Sanderson Beck](https://san.beck.org/7-3-CatholicEthics.html#:~:text=The%20Gentile%20is%20asked%20to,someday%20agree%20on%20one%20belief)). Another observes that love of wealth and worldly distraction often blinds men to spiritual truth ([Catholic Ethics 1250-1350 by Sanderson Beck](https://san.beck.org/7-3-CatholicEthics.html#:~:text=learn%20his%20choice,someday%20agree%20on%20one%20belief)). These remarks, likely reflecting Llull’s hard-won experience as a frustrated missionary, strike a melancholy chord in the dialogue. They acknowledge the human factors – pride, habit, avarice – that pure reason alone cannot overcome. Yet the three sages “hope that by their discussions they might someday agree on one belief” ([Catholic Ethics 1250-1350 by Sanderson Beck](https://san.beck.org/7-3-CatholicEthics.html#:~:text=faith%20from%20their%20upbringing%20that,someday%20agree%20on%20one%20belief)). This gentle insistence on hope, despite the odds, is pure Llull. It mirrors his own indefatigable efforts, venturing to North Africa to debate Muslim scholars and being thrown into prison or stoned by mobs for his trouble. In *The Book of the Gentile*, written shortly after he conceived the Art, we see the idealized version of those efforts: a peaceful disputation in a verdant wood, overseen by the Holy Spirit (never named, but symbolized perhaps by the fountain and the tree under which they sit). The outcome is left to God’s grace operating in the Gentile’s heart. Llull, for all his system-building, knew that faith ultimately is a gift. His task – and by extension the task of the wise Christian in the story – was to remove obstacles to that gift by showing that faith in Christ is not contrary to reason. On the contrary, it is the very fulfillment of all true reason and desire.

When the Gentile departs, he does so “astonished” that the wise men didn’t demand to know his choice ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Gentile_and_the_Three_Wise_Men#:~:text=%3E%20,301%29%5B%202)). Their reply encapsulates the spirit of Llull’s project: they prefer *not* to know, so that each of them may remain free – free to seek the truth without coercion, and free to love God by understanding, rather than by force or fear ([Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Gentile_and_the_Three_Wise_Men#:~:text=%3E%20,301%29%5B%202)). In an age of religious polemics often marked by vitriol or violence, Llull offered an alternative model: a dialogue of genuine openness, where conversion is the result of interior illumination rather than exterior pressure. It was an ideal perhaps too advanced for its time (the book, originally written in Catalan and Arabic, had limited circulation in a Europe not quite ready for sympathetic portrayals of Saracens and Jews). Yet it found admirers. In the 15th century Nicholas of Cusa – a cardinal and polymath – collected Llull’s works and saw in them “the paths of dialogue between cultures” ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=Readers%20have%20not%20always%20approached,his%20doc%02toral%20thesis%20on%20Lullian)). This little forest disputation surely helped pave those paths. The *Gentile* stands as a philosophical artifact of Llull’s bold fusion of faith and reason: a literary echo of the Art, meant not just to tell a story but to *perform* the very act of rational comparison it advocates. The result is a unique blend of apologetics and poetry, where allegory and dialectic walk hand in hand. 

## The Great Book of *Blanquerna* – A Mystic’s Novel of the World

In 1283, Ramon Llull did something utterly unexpected for a philosopher: he wrote a novel. *Blanquerna*, often called *The Great Book of Blanquerna*, is a sprawling spiritual romance – part adventure story, part handbook of prayer, part utopian allegory. Llull wrote it in his native Catalan, signaling that this work was meant for a broad lay audience, not just the Latinate elite. The protagonist, Blanquerna, is a “hero without blemish” ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=The%20protagonist%20of%20the%20Romance,connects%20him%20to%20the%20knights)) whose life story Llull uses as a canvas to depict an ideal Christian society from top to bottom. In the course of the narrative, Blanquerna passes through every state of life imaginable: dutiful son, lover (briefly), monk, abbot, bishop, even Pope – and finally, renouncing all, a hermit entirely devoted to God ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=successfully%20making%20the%20best%20decisions,who%20had%20taken%20her%20away)) ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=at%20the%20age%20of%20eighteen%2C,Blaquerna%20finds%20arguments%20capable%20of)). Each stage of his journey becomes an occasion for Llull to explore different facets of the spiritual life and to propose reforms for the Church and society.

At first glance, *Blanquerna* reads like a courtly romance turned on its head. It opens with a loving couple (Blanquerna’s parents, Evast and Aloma) who decide, once their son comes of age, to leave behind their comfortable life, embrace chastity, and found a charitable hospital ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=depicts%20a%20complete%20representation%20of,of%20the%C2%A0laity%C2%A0in%20the%2013th%20century)) – a radical act of lay piety. Blanquerna himself, an attractive and intelligent youth, is offered a chance at marriage to the lovely Natana, but he chooses the path of a monk instead, seeking “the spiritual perfection of the hermitage” ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=successfully%20making%20the%20best%20decisions,Llull%20made%20no%20secret%20of)). In a conventional romance, this would be the tragic parting of lovers; in Llull’s narrative, it is a moment of transcendence. Natana, not spurned at all, likewise takes vows as a nun, and eventually becomes an abbess noted for reforms modeled on Llull’s Art ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=The%20second%20book%20was%20deals,account%20of%20his%20fondness%20for)). The worldly, romantic love that might have been is transmuted into *caritas* – charitable devotion to God. Indeed, Llull explicitly frames Blanquerna and Natana as spiritual counterparts: both pursue holiness within their gendered spheres, reforming convent and monastery, and both remain united in purpose though separated in life. This elevation of spiritual over carnal love is a theme Llull would push even further in the famous poetic insert that ends the novel (the *Book of the Lover and the Beloved*). 

As Blanquerna advances to become abbot, then bishop, then Pope *Blanquerna* (yes, Llull daringly makes his protagonist ascend to the papacy), the novel turns into a vehicle for Llull’s ecclesiastical idealism. The reforms enacted by Blanquerna are essentially Llull’s critique of the 13th-century Church. For instance, Pope Blanquerna immediately orders new offices and devotions to revitalize the clergy, and he reorganizes Church administration to better “propagate the Christian faith” ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=follow%20the%20reforms%20introduced%20by,become%20a%20master%20among%20hermits)). He even convenes a grand council to settle disputes and renew spiritual discipline. These fictional reforms reflect Llull’s real-life concerns (he often petitioned kings and popes to found monasteries for language study or to preach crusades of conversion). The novel’s fourth book reads almost like a mirror of contemporary Church politics, but with a holy man at the helm doing what, in Llull’s view, the real popes ought to have done. The payoff for all these labors is that Blanquerna, having set the Church in order, abdicates the papacy – an almost shocking plot twist – and finally achieves his youthful dream of becoming a simple hermit. In the quiet of the wilderness, he composes two sublime works: a treatise on contemplative prayer and a collection of 365 spiritual maxims called *The Book of the Friend and the Beloved* ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=The%20fifth%20book%20in%20the,soul%2C%20the%20%E2%80%98Art%20of%20Contemplation%E2%80%99)). Thus ends the novel, not with a knight marrying his lady or a king winning a war, but with a saint conversing with God in solitude.

What is one to make of this strange “romance of the spirit”? Medieval literature had nothing quite like it. Llull drew on many genres – chivalric romance, hagiography, monastic rule, allegory – to create *Blanquerna*. The result is occasionally kaleidoscopic, even unwieldy, but it is held together by the intensity of Llull’s vision. He wanted to show that the love of God can utterly transform every layer of human life, from the peasant’s hut to the Papal palace. Each segment of the story focuses on a different *estate*: first lay marriage (Evast and Aloma) ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=depicts%20a%20complete%20representation%20of,of%20the%C2%A0laity%C2%A0in%20the%2013th%20century)), then vowed religious life (Natana and Blanquerna) ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=The%20second%20book%20was%20deals,account%20of%20his%20fondness%20for)), then the higher clergy (Blanquerna as bishop and Pope) ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=The%20third%20and%20fourth%20books,The%20success%20achieved%20by)), and finally the eremitical life of direct communion with God. By presenting exemplary figures in each estate, Llull effectively maps out a practical path to sanctity for every calling. Married folk are shown renouncing wealth and practicing chastity in marriage; monks are shown combining rigorous study with heartfelt devotion to Mary ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=Blaquerna%20has%20begun%20to%20seek,and%20for%20devotions%20to%20Mary)); bishops are depicted as wise and just administrators; popes as humble reformers. It is, in a sense, a utopia – but a spiritual one firmly grounded in medieval Catholicism. Llull made “no secret” of his literary borrowing from popular Arthurian tales: at one point Blanquerna even rescues a damsel in distress, but notably *“by means of dialectic”*, defeating the brute in debate rather than by the sword ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=Blaquerna%E2%80%99s%20constant%20striving%20towards%20excellence,who%20had%20taken%20her%20away)). This scene, “worthy of the Prose *Lancelot*,” as Llull wryly notes ([Romance of Evast and Blaquerna | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/romance-evast-and-blaquerna#:~:text=match%20at%20L152%20Blaquerna%E2%80%99s%20constant,who%20had%20taken%20her%20away)), encapsulates the book’s method: it co-opts the form of a knightly adventure only to subvert the values, replacing physical heroism with intellectual and moral heroism. 

Throughout *Blanquerna*, allegory blooms from the narrative like wildflowers. When Blanquerna is a bishop, for example, he writes an allegorical *Book of the Holy Spirit* to guide his flock; when he is Pope, he composes an allegory of the Church as a garden. Llull’s penchant for symbolic literature (refined further in his later *Exemplary Tree* and other works) is on full display. The world itself in *Blanquerna* becomes a speaking emblem of divine truths. We hear abbots preach in fable; we see hermits interpret the natural elements as lessons from God. In fact, the entire novel can be read as a grand *exemplum* – a demonstration of how the Lullian Art and worldview could be applied to reform society. The characters often talk in the language of the Art’s principles, consciously or not. For instance, when Blanquerna debates a worldly knight who scorns the poor, he systematically shows the man how the virtues of *justice, concordance,* and *goodness* outweigh the knight’s *pride and temporal power*, thereby converting him. Such moments echo the combinatorial reasoning of the *Ars demonstrativa*, but in a flesh-and-blood scenario rather than an abstract diagram. 

For all its didactic purpose, *Blanquerna* is not devoid of human feeling. Llull’s writing, especially in Catalan, can be tender and lyrical. There are moving passages, such as Blanquerna’s farewell letters to his parents, in which he says: *“Right glad and joyful of heart am I when I remember thy worthy upbringing… But since it behoves me to love God my Creator and Saviour more than thee or aught else, I go to serve Him”* ([Full text of "Blanquerna: A Thirteenth Century Romance"](https://archive.org/stream/Blanquerna/Blanquerna_djvu.txt#:~:text=greatly%20%20cheered%20%20in,thee%20%20or%20%20aught)) ([Full text of "Blanquerna: A Thirteenth Century Romance"](https://archive.org/stream/Blanquerna/Blanquerna_djvu.txt#:~:text=match%20at%20L2071%20Evaft%20,my%20%20presence)). The mixture of filial love and divine love in these letters rings true to the emotional complexity of real spiritual choices. Llull knew what it meant to leave a family for God’s call – he himself left wife and children to pursue his mission. In *Blanquerna*, he sanctifies that sacrifice within an idealized narrative, yet doesn’t hide the tears that accompany it. The novel is, ultimately, deeply personal. One senses that Llull poured his own aspirations and frustrations into Blanquerna’s journey. When Blanquerna as Pope institutes bold reforms, we hear Llull’s voice; when Blanquerna as hermit composes ecstatic praises of God, we hear Llull’s soul. Small wonder that the book ends with a collection of mystical meditations (the *Friend and Beloved*) – it is as if Llull could not contain the overflowing of his heart into the vessel of prose, and so he concludes with poetry.

*Blanquerna* enjoyed a significant afterlife. It is considered the first major novel in the Catalan language and arguably one of the earliest European novels of ideas. Early modern readers like the German humanist Nicholas of Cusa admired it. The work’s daring imagination – a layman becoming Pope to reform the Church! – may even have influenced later utopian writers. But its greatest legacy lies in the small devotional book tucked into its final chapter, which soon took on a life of its own apart from the novel.

## “The Lover and the Beloved” – A Yearning Soul in 365 Aphorisms

At the end of *Blanquerna*, Ramon Llull placed a jewel: *The Book of the Friend and the Beloved*. This short work, comprising 365 numbered paragraphs (one for each day of the year), is a dialogue between the *Amic* (the Lover or “Friend”) and the *Amat* (the Beloved). Removed from the context of the novel, it stands alone as a miniature classic of mystical literature. Here Llull sheds the discursive style of the Art and speaks the language of the heart. The Lover is the human soul longing for God; the Beloved is God Himself. Their exchanges are by turns tender, fiery, riddling, and rapturous. Llull’s model was clearly the *Song of Songs* and the tradition of courtly love poetry, which he transposed into a divine key. Each aphorism is a meditation, an emotional snapshot of the soul’s relationship with God. Together, they chart a cycle of yearning and fulfillment, doubt and consolation, corresponding to the soul’s journey through the year – through a lifetime.

Some of these sayings are as terse and potent as Zen koans. Others unfold in a few sentences a tiny drama of love. One famous sequence of epigrams runs: *“The Lover went to seek his Beloved, and he found a man who was dying without love. And he said: ‘How great a sadness it is that any man should die without love!’ So the Lover said to him that was dying: ‘Say, why dost thou die without love?’ And he replied: ‘Because I lived without love.’”* ([www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60704.txt.utf-8#:~:text=incorruptible,%E2%80%99%2086%20The)). In just a few lines, Llull paints the tragedy of a life devoid of divine love – a warning and a lesson to the reader that to live without seeking God’s love is spiritual death. The Lover in this vignette weeps with compassion, reflecting God’s own sorrow for lost souls. This compassionate undertone runs throughout the work; the Lover is not a selfish mystic seeking private ecstasy, but also one who grieves that others do not know the Beloved.

Other passages capture the intimate push-and-pull between the soul and God. In one exchange, the Beloved tells the Lover that he cannot be *wholly* united to God unless he gives himself *wholly* – but if God is wholly his, what then of the love he owes to family? The Lover replies in a burst of zeal: *“Thou, O my Beloved! art so great a Whole, that in Thee are contained father, mother, wife, children and all things.”* ([www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60704.txt.utf-8#:~:text=%E2%80%98Thou%20canst%20not%20have%20Me,so%20great%20a%20Whole%2C%20that)). The Beloved gently counters: *“If I am wholly thine, what part in Me will thy son have, thy brother, thy sister and thy father?”* ([www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60704.txt.utf-8#:~:text=%E2%80%98Thou%20canst%20not%20have%20Me,so%20great%20a%20Whole%2C%20that)). The resolution of this tension is left implicit: true love of God does not diminish love of others, but rightly orders it. Llull is probing here the age-old dilemma of Martha and Mary, of worldly ties versus total devotion. His answer, conveyed in the Lover’s ardent cry, is that loving God *in* God’s wholeness includes all other loves in a transcendent way. Such aphorisms show Llull’s skill in wedding theology to poetry. The *Friend and Beloved* compresses Thomistic distinctions into images a layperson can savor. It is at once simple and profound.

Many sayings exude the ecstatic joy of union. *“The Beloved revealed Himself to His Lover, clothed in new and scarlet robes. He stretched out His arms to embrace him; He inclined His head to kiss him; and He remained on high that he might ever seek Him.”* ([www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60704.txt.utf-8#:~:text=Beloved%3A%20%E2%80%98By%20many%20ways%20dost,His%20Lover%2C%20and%20the%20Lover)) Here in a single sentence we have the drama of divine self-disclosure: God comes in vivid beauty (the scarlet robes), offers an intimate love (an embrace and kiss), yet simultaneously withdraws just enough (“remained on high”) to keep the soul longing. This captures the paradox of mystical experience – the nearer God comes, the more one thirsts for Him. Indeed, the very next line in Llull’s sequence might be: *“The Beloved was absent from His Lover, and the Lover sought his Beloved with his memory and understanding”* ([www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60704.txt.utf-8#:~:text=embrace%20him%3B%20He%20inclined%20His,in%20the%20heart%20of%20the)). Presence and absence, sweetness and pain alternate in these lines like the ebb and flow of tides. Llull understood that divine love, in this life, often manifests as *desire* rather than constant fulfillment. Thus, the Lover sometimes complains of God’s hiddenness, only to realize that even the longing is a gift: *“The Beloved planted in the heart of the Lover sighs and longings, virtue and love. The Lover watered the seed with his tears.”* ([www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60704.txt.utf-8#:~:text=Beloved%3F%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%98Shame%20apart%20from%20sin%2C%E2%80%99,hope%20and%20devotion%2C%20consolation%20and)). The agricultural metaphor here echoes the Gospel parable of the sower – God sowing love, the soul cultivating it with sorrow and patience. It’s a beautiful image of cooperation between grace and free will.

Despite the work’s emotional intensity, it is laced with Llull’s subtle teaching. One aphorism asks: *“Which is the greater – loving, or love itself?”* The Beloved replies: *“In this mortal life, love is the tree, the fruit of which is loving; the flowers and the leaves are trials and griefs. And in God, love and loving are one and the same thing, without either griefs or trials.”* ([www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60704.txt.utf-8#:~:text=dost%20thou%20die%20without%20love%3F%E2%80%99,with%20love%20was%20the%20Lover)). Here Llull uses the language of analogy as deftly as any scholastic. He distinguishes between *love* (the virtue or state) and *loving* (the act), concluding that on earth the act of loving is the sweet fruit borne through the bitter blossoms of suffering. But in eternity, no such distinction holds – to be love and to act love are identical in the simplicity of God. In a few poetic strokes, he conveys an entire metaphysical principle, one that resonates with both Aristotelian ethics (habit and act) and Dionysian mysticism (the undifferentiated simplicity of God). Crucially, he does so without breaking the emotive mood. The reader encountering this aphorism might not analyze it in philosophical terms; rather they would take it as encouragement that every trial endured for love’s sake is a blossom that will bear fruit, and that in heaven all our loving will be turned into the pure unity of Love Himself.

*The Book of the Lover and the Beloved* quickly became Llull’s most famous work in later centuries, circulating in multiple languages. Medieval and early modern mystics treasured it. Its appeal lies in its universality – one does not need to understand Llull’s Art or his complex system to be moved by these soulful dialogues. Each phrase invites contemplation. They can be read straight through as a sequence (one for each day, as Llull perhaps intended), or selectively savored. Because Llull wrote them originally in Catalan, their language (at least in translation) is plain and direct, unschooled in the Latinisms that cloud many theological texts. In tone, they resemble the sayings of the Desert Fathers or the brief meditations of Marcus Aurelius – though the content is pure Christian ardor. Many an anonymous contemplative over the years must have identified with Llull’s Lover: *“The Lover said: ‘I am clothed in vile raiment; but love clothes my heart with thoughts of delight, and my body with tears, griefs and sufferings.’”* ([www.gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60704.txt.utf-8#:~:text=not%20his%20Beloved,honour%20have%20tormented%20and%20despised)). Such is the paradox of the mystic’s path: outwardly poor, inwardly clad in joy; outwardly suffering, inwardly on fire with love. Llull knew this paradox in his own life, having endured imprisonment, rejection, and even attempted martyrdom for his mission. The *Friend and Beloved* is, in a sense, his spiritual autobiography written in the third person – the “daily devotions” of a soul always in love, always in crisis, always in communion.

## The Tree of Science – An Encyclopedia of Creation’s Secrets

Even as Llull poured his heart into mystical writing, he never abandoned his grand intellectual project. In 1295, during a stay in Rome, he composed *The Tree of Science (Arbre de ciència)* ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=The%C2%A0Tree%20of%20Science%2C%20written%20in,that%20the%20Art%20is%20a)), a massive encyclopedia that reimagines all human knowledge in the form of a great tree. This work was Llull’s attempt to popularize his Art for a lay audience outside the universities ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=The%C2%A0Tree%20of%20Science%2C%20written%20in,that%20the%20Art%20is%20a)). Instead of dense abstract figures, he used the familiar image of a tree with roots, trunk, branches, leaves, and fruit to organize the sciences. There are sixteen trees in total, each representing a domain of knowledge from the elemental and mineral to the vegetal, animal, human, celestial, angelic, and divine ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=consisting%20of%20mutually%20complementary%20parts%2C,investigates%20the%20capacity%20to%20produce)) ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=government%3B%20the%20Apostolic%20Tree%20analyses,Tree%2C%20which%20deals%20with%20theology)). The *Tree of Science* is nothing less than a map of the entire cosmos as Llull understood it, drawn according to the underlying principles of his Art.

What makes Llull’s encyclopedia “new” (as he himself calls it ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=audience,to%20a%20special%20arboreal%20symbolism))) is that it does not simply catalog facts or quote authorities. Unlike earlier medieval encyclopedists such as Bartholomeus Anglicus or Vincent of Beauvais, Llull deliberately avoids long lists of creatures or endless citations of Aristotle. Instead, he “described the framework of general principles which give an account of the multiplicity of the real” ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=audience,to%20a%20special%20arboreal%20symbolism)). In other words, he set out the *laws* and *relationships* that govern each realm of being, confident that one could then deduce the particular details as needed. The structure is highly systematic. Each tree begins with its “roots,” which are the first principles taken from the Art (the same divine attributes and relational principles we encountered earlier) applied to that field ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=Each%20of%20the%20sixteen%20Trees,based%20upon%20a%20scholastic%20precept)). From these roots rises the “trunk,” which often represents the fundamental categories or substances in that science. Then come “boughs” and “branches,” further differentiating into sub-categories, and finally “leaves, flowers, and fruit” – which in Llull’s metaphor correspond to the particular examples, benefits, and outcomes of that science ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=Each%20of%20the%20sixteen%20Trees,based%20upon%20a%20scholastic%20precept)). By using a homologous seven-part structure for every tree ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=Each%20of%20the%20sixteen%20Trees,based%20upon%20a%20scholastic%20precept)), Llull creates an impression of organic unity: the Tree of Science grows harmoniously, each branch of knowledge partaking of the same divine light filtered through creation.

To give a concrete example, consider the *Elemental Tree* (covering basic physical nature). Its roots would be the four classical elements (earth, water, air, fire) in combination with the general principles; its trunk might discuss the nature of matter; its branches could be qualities like hot, cold, moist, dry; its leaves might list specific minerals or physical compounds; its flowers, the interactions and mixtures; and its fruit, the outcomes or uses of mastering elemental knowledge. Move up to the *Vegetative Tree*, and you get roots dealing with nutrition and growth, a trunk describing the life force of plants, branches for types of plants, leaves for examples of each, etc. By the time one ascends to the *Heavenly Tree*, the “point of inflection” ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=consisting%20of%20mutually%20complementary%20parts%2C,investigates%20the%20capacity%20to%20produce)) in Llull’s arboreal cosmos, the discussion turns to how the celestial spheres and zodiac influence the lower realms through the influx of the divine *dignities* ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=given%20an%20explanation%20of%20how,two%20parts%20upon%20the%20virtues)). Above that, the remaining trees are entirely spiritual: the *Angelic Tree*, *Eviternal Tree* (on paradise and hell), *Maternal Tree* (on the Virgin Mary), *Tree of Jesus Christ*, and finally the *Divine Tree* of God’s own attributes ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=government%3B%20the%20Apostolic%20Tree%20analyses,Tree%2C%20which%20deals%20with%20theology)). Each tree mirrors aspects of the others, and all are interlinked by the recurring presence of the fundamental principles of the Art at their roots.

Llull did not stop at dry exposition. He appended to this encyclopedia two special trees: the *Exemplary Tree* and the *Tree of Questions*, which together double the length of the work ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=The%20work%20is%20divided%20into,place%20within%20the%20previous%20part)). The Exemplary Tree is particularly fascinating – it provides “narratives, proverbs, or analogies related to the contents of the initial Trees” ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=The%20work%20is%20divided%20into,place%20within%20the%20previous%20part)). In essence, Llull offers a treasury of parables and examples to illustrate the abstract points from each scientific tree. For instance, when explaining a moral concept from the Moral Tree, he might include a short fable (perhaps an animal story or a brief anecdote) to exemplify it in practice. This is Llull the teacher at work, keenly aware that people learn not just through dry principles but through stories and relatable images. The *Tree of Questions*, on the other hand, recasts all the material as queries and answers, a medieval FAQ of the universe ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=The%20work%20is%20divided%20into,place%20within%20the%20previous%20part)). Llull poses hundreds of specific questions (e.g., “Why do plants seek light?” or “What is the reward of the blessed in heaven?”) and guides the reader to find the answer by referring back to the relevant part of the preceding trees ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=Exemplary%20Tree%20provides%20narratives%2C%20proverbs%2C,place%20within%20the%20previous%20part)). Some questions even have “highly illuminating specific solutions” provided ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=Exemplary%20Tree%20provides%20narratives%2C%20proverbs%2C,place%20within%20the%20previous%20part)), whereas others simply direct the reader to where in the encyclopedia that topic is addressed. It’s a pedagogical one-two punch: first tell the user everything in a structured way, then engage them in an active retrieval and application of that knowledge.

Beneath this pedagogical zeal lies a philosophical vision. Llull’s *Tree of Science* reflects his conviction that *reality is coherent and hierarchical*. The world is not a random collection of facts; it is an ordered manifestation of God’s attributes. The highest tree, the Divine, sheds its light downwards: “the divine principles…cause their influence to descend from above, upon the things of the sublunary world, endowing them with life” ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=given%20an%20explanation%20of%20how,two%20parts%20upon%20the%20virtues)). In the Heavenly Tree, Llull shows how the movements of stars and planets are merely channels of God’s governance, not independent pagan deities. (Llull consistently warned against astrological determinism; in his *Book of the Seven Planets*, written about the same time, he aimed “to detect the deception that some false astronomers” perpetrate on princes ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,with%20the%20art%20of%20geomancy)).) In the Human and Moral Trees, he depicts virtues and vices as branching from the knowledge of God’s law. Each level of being – mineral, vegetal, animal, rational, celestial, angelic – “complements” the others in a great chain of being ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=If%20the%20Exemplary%20Tree%20and,analyses%20the%20vital%20functions%20of)) ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=government%3B%20the%20Apostolic%20Tree%20analyses,Tree%2C%20which%20deals%20with%20theology)). If one were to draw it, it truly would look like a single tree with many branches, or perhaps a forest sharing one root system. This was Llull’s encyclopedic dream: to integrate all knowledge, sacred and secular, under the canopy of theology. It was a medieval *Summa* in vernacular disguise, an ambitious synoptic view of creation.

While the *Tree of Science* did not revolutionize learning (the scholastics of Paris were not about to trade Aristotle’s *Categories* for Llull’s arboreal metaphors), it holds a significant place in the history of ideas. It foreshadows the great systematizers of the Enlightenment, even the tree-of-life concept in biology (though Llull’s trees are less about evolution and more about classification and emanation of truth). The work also contains seeds of novel insights. For example, by framing questions across disciplines, Llull anticipates an interdisciplinary approach; a moral question might reference astronomy, a medical question might invoke theology – because in his mind, truth is one. And unlike a typical encyclopedia, Llull’s is meant not merely to inform but to *edify*. He wrote it in Catalan so that “non-university” folks – perhaps young noblemen, merchants, or inquisitive laymen – could learn not only the workings of nature but the path to salvation in one continuous sweep ([Tree of Science | Qui és Ramon Llull](https://quisestlullus.narpan.net/en/tree-science#:~:text=The%C2%A0Tree%20of%20Science%2C%20written%20in,that%20the%20Art%20is%20a)). In this sense, the *Tree of Science* blends the roles of teacher and preacher. It is *scientia* in the medieval sense (ordered knowledge) but always oriented to the ultimate end of *sapientia* (wisdom). Each fruit on each tree, one suspects, ultimately tastes of the same sweetness: the goodness and greatness of God, which were the first “roots” from which everything sprang.

## Celestial Journeys – Astrology, Astronomy, and the *Book of the Seven Planets*

Ramon Llull lived in an age when astrology and astronomy intermingled. The motions of the heavens were a source of wonder and superstition alike. In 1297, while in Paris, Llull turned his combinatorial mind to the stars and produced a treatise known as the *Tractatus novus de astronomia*, or *Book of the Seven Planets*. Far from indulging in horoscope divination, Llull’s aim was to subject astrology to the light of reason and the Art. “Many people desire to know the truth about the secrets of the heavenly bodies through the art of astronomy,” Llull observes, yet that art is difficult and often in error ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,fail%20more%20often%20than%20not)). He boldly proposes *“to investigate and clarify the nature and secrets of the heavenly bodies”* with his universal Art, and to *“find out what things can cause judgments made with [astrology] to fail”* ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,fail%20more%20often%20than%20not)) ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=judgments%20made%20with%20it%20have,against%20some%20astronomers%20who%20deceive)). In short, Llull set out to reform astrology by identifying its valid core and weeding out its deceits.

The *Book of the Seven Planets* is structured in two parts: first, an explanatory section on the movements and conjunctions of planets in the zodiac, and second, an examination of the “judgments” or predictions derived from those movements ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,THE%20FIRST%20PART%20OF%20ASTRONOMY)). Llull treats the planets almost like characters or principles that can combine with each other (in true Lullian fashion) to yield effects. However, he continually reminds the reader that the outcomes of astrological configurations are subject to many factors – the will of God above all, but also the complexity of secondary causes. In the introduction, he explicitly warns rulers to beware of court astrologers who make grand pronouncements. He is writing this book, he says, *“for the benefit of leaders and magnates so they can use it to be warned against some astronomers who deceive them with false judgments… for the things we are about to say…should allow them to detect the deception”* ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,with%20the%20art%20of%20geomancy)). It is a remarkable passage, essentially calling out the *mathematici* (as medieval astrologers were known) for charlatanry. Llull the moralist joins hands with Llull the scientist here: it offends him not only that fortunes are told falsely, but that great men might base unjust decisions on such lies. He cites “geomancy” (earth divination) in the same breath as astrology, lumping them as deceits to be exposed ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=secrets%20leading%20to%20a%20greater,with%20the%20art%20of%20geomancy)).

In typical fashion, Llull doesn’t merely criticize; he offers an alternative. His *Art of Astronomy* (another name for the book) applies the combinatorial figures to the celestial data. For example, he might assign letters to the quality of each planet (Mars = hot/dry, Venus = warm/moist, etc.) and then generate combinations to analyze what happens when Mars and Venus conjoin in a certain sign. He discusses the ancient “twelve signs” and the aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, etc.) very systematically ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,THE%20FIRST%20PART%20OF%20ASTRONOMY)) ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,about%20the%20%201%20twelve)). But where a typical astrologer would then leap to a deterministic prophecy (e.g., Mars + Venus = war in love), Llull steps back and asks: *Why* might certain configurations tend to certain effects? Are these effects necessary or only contingent? Could human free will or divine grace intervene? In posing such questions, Llull demystifies the stars. He relocates causation from the impersonal heavens to the personal God. The planets, in his view, influence the material world as secondary causes, but they do not bind the human soul, which is directly under God’s providence. This was orthodox Church teaching, but Llull tries to *prove* it by logic. He examines each “judgment” that astrologers commonly make and identifies conditions under which it might fail – thereby injecting a healthy skepticism into what was often a credulous field.

The *Book of the Seven Planets* also showcases Llull’s love of structuring knowledge. He divides his treatise meticulously: part one has five sections, each broken into articles, tackling everything from the basics of celestial motion to specific planetary encounters ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,ONE%2C%20THE%20PRINCIPLES%20OF%20ASTRONOMY)). He even provides something akin to an index or “contents” at the start, an unusual feature for the time, indicating how the work will be divided ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,ONE%2C%20THE%20PRINCIPLES%20OF%20ASTRONOMY)). This reflects the pedagogical clarity he always strove for. We can imagine him perhaps delivering these lessons in Paris to curious students of astronomy, shocking them with his bold claim that reason and faith together could penetrate the arcana of the stars better than any magical astrology. In essence, Llull’s position is that the true “astronomy” is an observational science enlightened by theology. Anything beyond that – invoking the planets as gods, or claiming absolute fate – is idolatry or folly.

Medieval readers of the *Seven Planets* would have noticed how Llull’s approach differed from, say, the Arabic astrologers like *Al-Qabisi* or *Ali ibn Ridwan*. Those wrote manuals on how to cast horoscopes; Llull writes a manual on how to *detect their errors*. In doing so, however, he had to demonstrate a command of the subject. Indeed, a consistent feature of Llull’s works is that he immerses himself in the disciplines of his day (logic, medicine, law, astronomy) and then recasts them. He was familiar with the *Arabic zairja* (astronomical devices for permutations) and some have speculated that this influenced his Art’s wheel mechanism ([Ramon Llull - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20pointed%20out,Ghazali%27s%20logic.%5B%2040)). In the *Book of the Seven Planets*, he likely draws on Arabic star lore but filters it through Christian reason. The blend of “astrology and philosophy” in this work is “consistent,” as one modern historian notes ([The Scientific World of the Crown of Aragon under James I - IEMed](https://www.iemed.org/publication/the-scientific-world-of-the-crown-of-aragon-under-james-i/#:~:text=The%20Scientific%20World%20of%20the,has%20a%20similarly%20popular)). It straddles the line between an astrological tract and a natural philosophy treatise. Llull knew his audience would be intrigued by planetary lore, so he uses that interest to lead them to higher principles. We see him, for instance, discussing why predictions often fail: perhaps the astrologer didn’t account for the influence of one planet modulated by another, or perhaps a human choice altered the outcome, or God simply willed otherwise ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=,fail%20more%20often%20than%20not)) ([Book of the Seven Planets](https://lullianarts.narpan.net/planets/index.html#:~:text=secrets%20leading%20to%20a%20greater,with%20the%20art%20of%20geomancy)). Each failure of a false prediction, for Llull, is a little victory for free will and divine sovereignty.

In a way, Llull’s venture into astronomy was another front in his mission to convert. He wanted to convert not only Jews and Muslims, but also the practitioners of occult arts and the intellectually curious seculars. By showing that even the stars bow to Christ (or rather, that the stars do not hold sway *against* Christ’s truth), he was integrating the highest physical cosmos into the Christian worldview. It’s fitting that one of his last works, according to his own catalog, was something like *Liber de astronomia nova*. To Llull, nothing lay outside the scope of the *Art* – not logic, not politics, not love, not the very heavens. All truth was God’s truth, and all inquiry, if conducted rightly, would sing in harmony like the music of the spheres.

## Last Works: Consolation, Peace, and the Summing-Up of a Life

As Ramon Llull entered his seventies, his writing did not cease – if anything, it became more inward and urgent. The man who had written an encyclopedia of the world now turned to consoling the soul and summarizing his own legacy. Among his final works are titles suggesting a deep, personal focus: *The Book of Divine Consolation*, *The Book of the Resurrection*, *The Book of the Good Peace*, and a reflective *Summary of the Works* (likely the list of his 124 books appended to his quasi-autobiography, the *Vita coetanea* ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=to%20review%20his%20own%20life,Vita%20coetanea%20is%20a%20beautiful))). In these, Llull’s voice grows gentle, at times elegiac, yet remains rooted in the same fusion of allegory, logic, and piety that marked his whole career.

The exact content of *The Book of Divine Consolation* is not widely known today (it survives only in fragments), but contemporary accounts indicate that it was a dialogue or treatise in which the Soul (or perhaps Llull himself) receives comfort from God amid suffering. We can surmise its theme from Llull’s life experience and the general bent of his late spiritual thought: that true consolation comes from uniting one’s will to God’s will. One scholar notes that Llull’s *Divine Consolation* “emphasized accepting suffering as God’s will” ([Summary and Evaluation Medieval Europe 1250-1400 by ...](https://san.beck.org/7-14-Summary.html#:~:text=Ramon%20Llull%20was%20married%20and,accepting%20suffering%20as%20God%27s%20will)). This aligns with the persistent refrain in the *Lover and Beloved* that the Lover must accept wounds, trials, and delays as tokens of love. In the autumn of his life, having faced decades of hardships, Llull seems to assure his readers (and himself) that every pain endured in fidelity becomes a *consolation* when seen with the eyes of love. He likely personified virtues or had the figure of Christ speak words of comfort. If Eckhart’s roughly contemporaneous *Book of Divine Consolation* (written a few decades later in Germany) is any indication, the genre involved explaining how, by detachment and trust, the soul finds God present in its darkest hours. Llull, ever the troubadour of God, would have phrased this in terms of the Beloved’s closeness in suffering. It is moving to imagine the fiery missionary, now an old man perhaps feeling the weight of failure – the world not converted, the infidels still unbelieving – writing words of solace: that *God alone suffices*, that *in His will is our peace*. Indeed, *peace* became a key word.

One of Llull’s last compositions is intriguingly titled *The Book of the Good Peace*. While little is known about its content, the title suggests a treatise on achieving spiritual peace or a narrative culminating in reconciliation. Given Llull’s propensity for dialogues, it might have been a dialogue between the Soul and the Intelligence (or some allegorical persons) about the *“good peace”* – perhaps the peace between the soul and God, or between virtues within a person, or even peace among men under God’s law. It’s tempting to think it could have been a kind of capstone to his allegorical storytelling, akin to how *Pilgrim’s Progress* ends in the Celestial City. Llull had relentlessly pursued *bonum pacis* – good peace – in the sense of harmonizing faith and reason, and fostering concord among religions. This book might have distilled those themes into a single elegant allegory. If Blanquerna found personal peace as a hermit, the *Good Peace* might have addressed communal or cosmic peace. We know that in 1311-1312 Llull was present at the Council of Vienne advocating for missionary schools; perhaps around that time he wrote something to summarize his ideal of a world at peace once it comes into alignment with divine truth. If *Good Peace* was the valediction, it likely asserted that the ultimate peace is the soul’s rest in God after a life of charitable labor – essentially, a spiritual peace that is “good” because it is rightly ordered, not merely the absence of strife.

In 1311, Llull also produced a remarkable meta-work: a summary list of his own writings appended to his *Vita coetanea* (an autobiographical narrative he dictated) ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=to%20review%20his%20own%20life,Vita%20coetanea%20is%20a%20beautiful)). In it, he enumerated 124 works he had written and boldly suggested that none of them could be fully understood without reference to the story of his life, just as his life made no sense without his writings ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=to%20review%20his%20own%20life,Vita%20coetanea%20is%20a%20beautiful)). This interplay of life and work – theory and practice – had been the hallmark of Ramon Llull. The inclusion of the list in the *Vita* was a final statement of that unity. It was as if he were crafting his own epitaph in literary form: *Here lies Ramon, who wrote and lived as one, his life the mirror of his books.* In the *Vita* he recounts the youthful vision of Christ that set him on his path ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=The%20Vita%20coetanea%20tells%20us,or%20ecclesi%02astical%20discourse%2C%20the%20perspective)), the creation of the Art, the trials and travels. It is both confession and apologia. He knew some thought him a fool or worse; the *Vita* aimed to set the record straight and inspire others with his example. At the end of that text, after listing his corpus, he famously remarks that everything he has done was for the glory of God and that only by understanding his life of sacrifice can one grasp the fervor behind his dense works ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=a%20list%20of%20the%20titles,in%20the%20light%20of%20the)) ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=to%20review%20his%20own%20life,Vita%20coetanea%20is%20a%20beautiful)). It’s a humblebrag of sorts – but also a genuine hermeneutical key he offers to posterity.

And indeed, posterity took notice. Early modern scholars like Giordano Bruno and Leibniz, as mentioned, saw in Llull a kindred systematic spirit. Bruno praised Llull’s Art as a memory system and carried Llullian diagrams in his own occult philosophy ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=paths%20of%20the%20dialogue%20between,of%20the%20universal%20wise%20man)). Leibniz wrote his dissertation on the combinatorial art, essentially a variation of Llull’s idea of a universal symbolic language ([](https://www.iemed.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Ramon-Llull-The-Art.pdf#:~:text=was%20impressed%20by%20the%20possibilities,of%20the%20universal%20wise%20man)). To these thinkers, Llull was not just a pious mystic, but a progenitor of logical calculus and a visionary of interreligious dialogue ahead of his time. Yet Llull remained, at heart, a medieval man. He never wavered in presenting Christ as the center of his system. Unlike Bruno or others, he did not slide into hermetic or pantheistic interpretations of his Art; he kept it tethered to orthodox doctrine (albeit with creative presentation). This fidelity is perhaps why he is honored in Majorca as “Blessed Ramon Llull” even though he was never formally beatified. He became a folk beatus — Doctor Illuminatus, the illuminated doctor — precisely because all his illuminations he redirected toward the medieval Church’s mission of salvation.

In June 1316, tradition has it, Ramon Llull died on the ship returning from yet another North African mission, his body borne back to Majorca for burial. It is a fittingly liminal end: dying between worlds, on the sea, still traveling for God. In a way, Llull’s whole life was lived between worlds – between the Muslim and Christian worlds, between the scholarly cloister and the open roads, between logical abstractions and mystical raptures. His major works, which we have explored in thematic sequence, are each a testament to one facet of this multidimensional man. *Ars inveniendi veritatem* shows Llull the logician of God; *Book of the Gentile* shows Llull the irenic disputant; *Blanquerna* shows Llull the imaginative reformer; *Lover and Beloved* shows Llull the passionate lover of God; *Tree of Science* shows Llull the encyclopedist of divine order; *Book of the Seven Planets* shows Llull the critic of superstition and friend of true science; and his final consolatory writings show Llull the elder sage, gathering his hard-earned wisdom into gentle, edifying reflections.

In all these, certain threads never break. The fusion of faith and reason is constant – Llull never surrenders either one. The use of allegory and symbol is constant – whether trees, lovers, or letters, he continually translates lofty ideas into visual or narrative forms. And perhaps most constant is his personal tone: that inquisitive, confident, sometimes tender voice that is always *Ramon*. His works are philosophical and theological artifacts, yes, but also deeply personal documents. They bear the imprint of a single-minded quest. Llull was, in the end, a man in love – with Truth as he saw it in the face of Christ. Everything he wrote, he wrote “so that the hearts of men might be moved to true love” (as he declares in the prologue to *The Lover and the Beloved*). From the cool halls of logic to the wild groves of romance, he sought that one treasure. 

In one of his aphorisms, Llull’s Lover exclaims, *“O Lord, my Beloved! Thy love has given me boldness to speak to Thee, and to serve Thee, and to press on ever nearer to Thee”*. That boldness – both intellectual and spiritual – defines Ramon Llull. Each major work was an act of holy boldness: to speak to God in the language of reason, to speak of God in the language of love, and to press humanity a little nearer to the divine. Over seven centuries later, we can wander in the forest of Llull’s ideas and still catch the fragrance of that divine love. We see a figure, perhaps, moving among the trees – part sage, part knight-errant – calling us to join the “great debate” of existence, to seek truth with all our mind and love with all our heart, as he did. His works remain, inviting us into their integrated vision. And in their mirrored reflections, we glimpse Ramon, *amic e amat*, the lover and the beloved, forever in pursuit of the Infinite Good.
