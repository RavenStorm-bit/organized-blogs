Excellent. I’ll begin crafting a longform, chapter-style, thematic essay that captures the essence of Thomas Aquinas’ thought across his major works. I’ll stay grounded in the original texts, quoting extensively, drawing on the best English translations and academic commentary, while writing in a rich, narrative style that feels like a deep journalistic profile from the golden age of The New Yorker. This will be the first chapter of a multi-part deep dive into the raw mind of Aquinas.

I’ll get started now and let you know once the first installment is ready.

# Thomas Aquinas and the Architecture of Being

**Introduction – The Scholastic Blueprint:**  
In the high scholastic age of the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas attempted nothing less than a total mapping of reality – a metaphysical master-plan drawn with Aristotelian precision and Augustinian depth. His major works, from the encyclopedic *Summa Theologica* to the philosophical treatise *De Ente et Essentia*, construct an “architecture of being” that strives to reconcile reason and faith into a single coherent vision. A traditional tone suffuses his writing, yet a subtle skepticism – a relentless questioning – undergirds his method. Aquinas is not content with pat answers; he poses objections to every claim (often channeling his inner critic) before forging his *respondeo* (“I answer that…”) with careful argument. The result is a rich, layered narrative: an intellectual cathedral of sorts, where philosophy’s classical pillars support the soaring arches of theology. As one modern scholar observes, Aquinas “takes inspiration from antiquity, especially Aristotle, and builds something entirely new” ([
Thomas Aquinas (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#:~:text=Between%20antiquity%20and%20modernity%20stands,countless%20elaborations%20and%20disputations%20among)). In this essay, we journey through the thematic chapels of Aquinas’ thought – being and essence, God’s nature, creation and evil, the soul, virtue and law, and the grand synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy with Christian doctrine – letting Aquinas speak for himself whenever possible. We’ll keep our tone respectful and analytic (with a dash of Gen Z wit to keep things lively). After all, exploring existence itself shouldn’t be *too* dry – even if we’re delving into questions that can trigger an existential headache or two.

## I. Being and Essence: The Ground Floor of Reality  
Aquinas begins with the most fundamental questions: *What does it mean to be? What is the essence of a thing?* In his short treatise *De Ente et Essentia* (“On Being and Essence”), written for young scholars, he warns that even a tiny mistake about first principles can cascade into huge errors down the line. “A small error at the outset can lead to great errors in the final conclusions,” he writes, invoking Aristotle’s cautionary maxim ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=A%20small%20error%20at%20the,showing%20how%20each%20may%20be)). Thus, before building upwards into theology, Aquinas lays a foundation by clarifying *ens* (being) and *essentia* (essence). The intellect’s first act, he notes, is to conceive *being*, and next to conceive *essence* – the *whatness* of a thing ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=A%20small%20error%20at%20the,showing%20how%20each%20may%20be)). 

What exactly is *essence*? Aquinas explains that essence is what makes a thing *that kind of thing* – the inner principle by which it is categorized. Following Aristotle, he distinguishes two senses of *being*: in one sense, being signifies anything that exists in reality (divided into the ten categories like substance, quantity, quality, etc.); in another sense, being signifies the truth of propositions (so even negations or privations can “be” true in this logical sense) ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=As%20the%20Philosopher%20says%20in,that%20affirmation%20is%20opposed%20to)) ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=negation%2C%20or%20that%20blindness%20is,14%2C%20the%20Commentator%20explains%20the)). Essence, however, is concerned with being in the first sense – real existence. For example, blindness can “be” true of an eye (in the second, logical sense), but blindness has no essence or reality of its own (it’s just the lack of sight) ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=In%20this%20way%2C%20privations%20and,Rather%2C%20the%20term)). Essence, Aquinas says, corresponds to *form* – what a thing is – especially in substances. “The term *essence* is taken from being in the first sense,” he writes, “for in this sense being signifies the essence of a thing” ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=The%20term%20essence%20is%20not,And%20since%2C%20as%20said%20above)). In other words, essence answers *what* something is (its quiddity or nature), while being (in the first sense) indicates *that* something is.

Crucially, Aquinas inherits from Avicenna and others the insight that in most creatures there is a real distinction between essence and existence. A horse, a tree, or a person has an essence (what it is) distinct from the fact that it exists. Its essence *could* exist or not – there is no built-in guarantee. We can grasp what a phoenix or a unicorn would be (their essence) even if they do not in fact exist. Existence is, so to speak, “added” to essence in contingent beings. But what about God? Here Aquinas lays the cornerstone of his metaphysics: in God alone, essence and existence are identical ([
           St. Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologica -
        Christian Classics Ethereal Library
](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q3_A4.html#:~:text=I%20answer%20that%2C%20God%20is,is%20impossible%20for%20a%20thing%27s)) ([Thomas Aquinas: Compendium theologiae: English](https://isidore.co/aquinas/Compendium.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L757%20it%20is,nothing%20else%20than%20His%20existence)). “I answer that, God is not only His own essence... but also His own existence,” he writes plainly in the *Summa Theologica* ([
           St. Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologica -
        Christian Classics Ethereal Library
](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q3_A4.html#:~:text=I%20answer%20that%2C%20God%20is,is%20impossible%20for%20a%20thing%27s)). Any being whose existence differs from its essence must have its existence caused by another (since nothing can cause its own existence if existence is a separable attribute) ([
           St. Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologica -
        Christian Classics Ethereal Library
](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q3_A4.html#:~:text=I%20answer%20that%2C%20God%20is,constituent%20principles%2C%20for%20nothing%20can)). But God, being the *First Cause*, cannot have a caused existence – therefore “it is impossible that in God His existence should differ from His essence” ([
           St. Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologica -
        Christian Classics Ethereal Library
](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q3_A4.html#:~:text=Therefore%20that%20thing%2C%20whose%20existence,Therefore%20His)). In the succinct formulation of Aquinas’s later *Compendium Theologiae*, “in God… there is no distinction between what He is and that whereby He is… Therefore God’s essence is nothing else than His existence” ([Thomas Aquinas: Compendium theologiae: English](https://isidore.co/aquinas/Compendium.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L757%20it%20is,nothing%20else%20than%20His%20existence)). 

This doctrine may sound abstract, but it has profound implications. It positions God as the ultimate *ipsum esse subsistens* – the sheer act of “to-be” itself – while every creature is a compound of *essence* plus an act of *existing* received from God. Already we see Aquinas’s architectural vision: reality is a participated hierarchy of being, with the Creator as the uncaused cause of *all* existence. As one commentator explains, Aquinas “adopted Aristotle’s conception of metaphysics as the science of being” and made it serve theology ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=forming%20his%20basis%20for%20inference,the%20%E2%80%9Cform%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20body)). He draws distinctions like *act and potency*, *substance and accident*, *form and matter* – the whole Aristotelian toolkit – to describe how creatures exist. But he does so in a framework deeply informed by Christian doctrine, integrating insights of Neoplatonism (e.g. the notion of existence as *participation* in God’s superabundant being) without abandoning empirical realism. It’s a delicate balance, or as we might quip today, Thomas was doing the “both/and” long before it was cool. He would firmly insist that being is *analogically* common to God and creatures – not a univocal concept. Any similarity between Creator and creature “is always outweighed by an even greater dissimilarity” (as the Fourth Lateran Council taught) ([Analogia entis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogia_entis#:~:text=but%20analogies,maior%20dissimulitudo%20in%20tanta%20similitudine)) ([Analogia entis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogia_entis#:~:text=,)). Thus Aquinas’ famous *analogia entis* (analogy of being) maintains that while we can truly speak of God as *being*, *good*, *wise*, etc., we must remember these perfections exist in Him in an infinitely higher mode than in us ([Analogia entis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogia_entis#:~:text=The%20analogia%20entis%20,and%20devotional%20ramifications%20of%20this)) ([Analogia entis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogia_entis#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20called%20a,maior%20dissimulitudo%20in%20tanta%20similitudine)). Our language about God is neither purely literal nor utterly equivocal – it is proportional, a guided stretching of meaning toward One who ultimately exceeds our grasp. In Aquinas’ own words, “our understanding is at a loss” when it tries to comprehend God’s substance directly ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=doctrine%20of%20the%20Philosopher%2C%20that,objects%20beyond%20sense%20cannot%20be)), yet by examining his effects (the created world) we can at least *infer* that He exists and something of what He is not ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=Nicom,matter%20is%20an)) ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=doctrine%20of%20the%20Philosopher%2C%20that,objects%20beyond%20sense%20cannot%20be)).

Before moving upward, let’s pause at this ground floor of being and essence. Aquinas’s tight reasoning here might seem, well, *extra* – but he saw it as necessary groundwork for everything else. In *De Ente et Essentia*, after defining essence, he proceeds to classify how essence exists in different types of beings. At the summit is God: *His* essence just *is* existence, utterly simple and unique ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=way%20God%20has%20his%20essence%2C,of%20which%20it%20is%20the)). “God does not have a quiddity or essence *because* His essence is not other than His existence,” Aquinas explains ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=way%20God%20has%20his%20essence%2C,of%20which%20it%20is%20the)). Because of this, God doesn’t belong to any genus; He isn’t just another item in the category of “beings” – He *is* the source of the category itself ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=quiddity%20or%20essence%20because%20his,of%20which%20it%20is%20the)). In created intellectual beings (like angels), essence and existence are distinct, but there is no matter – their forms exist in a composite way only of form and the act of existence given by God ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=alone%2C%20and%20this%20is%20the,quiddity%20or%20form%20that%20is)) ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=way%20God%20has%20his%20essence%2C,From)). In material creatures (like us), essence comprises both form and matter, and existence is received through that compounded essence ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=with%20respect%20to%20the%20existence,matter%20and%20form%2C%20unless%20in)) ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=way%20God%20has%20his%20essence%2C,From)). The hierarchy continues downward in complexity. Aquinas the metaphysical architect is effectively drawing a blueprint: God as the self-subsistent Act of Being, intellects (angels) as pure forms given existence, humans as form-and-matter compounds with existence, and so on down to the simplest material elements. It’s systematic and (dare we say) a bit OCD, but hey, this is what happens when you let a 13th-century friar obsess over *ontos* and *ousia*. 

If all this sounds abstract, Aquinas would gently remind us that knowing *being* is the start of all knowledge. “Being and essence are the first things conceived by the intellect,” he says ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=De%20Caelo%20et%20Mundo%20cap,intentions%20of%20genus%2C%20species%2C%20and)), which might be scholastic-speak for “you’ve got to know the basic *stuff* of reality before you can do anything else.” In modern Gen Z lingo, you need to learn your ABCs (Aquinas’s Basic Categories?) before writing poetry. By nailing down the distinction between *what* a thing is and *that* it is, Aquinas sets up the rest of his system: he can now talk about *how* things exist (contingently or necessarily), *in whom* they exist originally (God), and *how* they relate to each other in the grand scheme. The stage is set to introduce the main character: the Necessary Being that gives all other beings existence.

## II. God: Pure Act and the One Who Is  
At the heart of Aquinas’s architecture stands God, the ipsum esse – the Is of is’s. When Aquinas moves in the *Summa Theologica* from creatures to the Creator, his tone becomes by turns reverent and analytical, almost as if he’s tiptoeing into the Holy of Holies with a measuring tape. The *Summa* opens **Prima Pars** (the First Part) with the nature of God, and Aquinas famously offers his “Five Ways” to prove God’s existence. But just as important as *that* God exists is *what* God is (as far as we can determine) – and especially what God is *not*. Aquinas builds a via negativa: God is not composite, not material, not imperfect, not finite. “In God there is no composition,” he argues, therefore no distinction between essence and existence, substance and attributes, etc. ([Thomas Aquinas: Compendium theologiae: English](https://isidore.co/aquinas/Compendium.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L757%20it%20is,nothing%20else%20than%20His%20existence)). One by one, Aquinas knocks down the walls of any anthropomorphic notion of God. The result is an impressive negative theology that paradoxically tells us a great deal about the Divine. God is *simple* (without parts), *perfect*, *good*, *infinite*, *immutable*, *eternal*, *one*. Each of these gets a question in the *Summa* backed by arguments and patristic authorities.

Perhaps the most fundamental description Aquinas gives is that God is *actus purus* – Pure Act, with no admixture of potentiality. This follows from God’s simplicity and the essence–existence unity discussed earlier. “Existence is that which makes every form or nature actual,” Aquinas notes ([
           St. Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologica -
        Christian Classics Ethereal Library
](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q3_A4.html#:~:text=should%20differ%20from%20His%20essence,is%20His%20own%20essence%2C%20as)). In anything that isn’t God, essence is like potential waiting to be actualized by the act of existing. But in God, there is no such gap: He is all act, no potency ([
           St. Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologica -
        Christian Classics Ethereal Library
](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q3_A4.html#:~:text=should%20differ%20from%20His%20essence,is%20His%20own%20essence%2C%20as)). Using another Aristotelian angle, Aquinas explains that God contains within Himself all the perfections of being, in the most eminent way. *De Ente et Essentia* states this idea splendidly: “Although God is existence alone, the remaining perfections and nobilities are not lacking in him. On the contrary, He has all the perfections that exist in every genus… but God has these perfections in a more excellent way… in Him they are one, while in other things they are diverse” ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20although%20God%20is%20existence,this%20reason%20he%20is%20called)) ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=And%20this%20is%20because%20all,a%20person%20would%20have%20in)). In creatures, goodness, wisdom, power, life, etc., are distinct qualities; in God, they all *are* the single act of His existence. It’s the ultimate simplicity – not the simplicity of a child’s drawing but of a blinding white light containing all colors.

Aquinas thus navigates between extreme apophaticism and anthropomorphism with his doctrine of analogy. We can say “God is good” or “God is wise” truly, but we must understand the sense is analogical, not exactly the same as when we call a human good or wise ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=forming%20his%20basis%20for%20inference,the%20%E2%80%9Cform%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20body)). The difference is infinite. As Aquinas puts it (citing the *Liber de Causis* and others), God’s being is so pure that “no addition can be made to it” – it transcends all categories ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=Even%20though%20we%20say%20that,God%20is%20of%20such%20a)). Yet creatures do reflect God in a fragmentary way. The diversity of created perfections are like scattered rays; in God’s singular perfection, they are unified in one beam. He is, in a phrase Aquinas loves, *ipsum bonum*, *ipsa sapientia* – goodness itself, wisdom itself. To underscore the point, *De Ente* even notes that some philosophers refused to say God has an “essence” because that term usually implies a defined quiddity; better to say God’s only “essence” is *to be* ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=way%20God%20has%20his%20essence%2C,From)). In scholastic terms: God is in a class by Himself (and that class has exactly one member).

While the *Summa Theologica* is Aquinas’s most systematic treatment, the *Summa Contra Gentiles* (a work aimed at explaining and defending the faith through reason) often waxes eloquent on God’s nature as well. In SCG Book I, for instance, Aquinas begins by praising the pursuit of wisdom as what leads humans to God. “Of all human pursuits, the pursuit of wisdom is the more perfect, the more sublime, the more useful, and the more agreeable,” he writes, since wisdom brings true happiness, likens us to God, and guides us to an everlasting kingdom ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=OF%20all%20human%20pursuits%2C%20the,conversation%20hath%20no%20bitterness%2C%20nor)). The goal of wisdom, of course, is truth – ultimately the truth about God. And truth, Aquinas daringly asserts, is “the final end of the whole universe” ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=Now%20the%20last%20end%20of,and%20every%20truth%2C%20but%20of)) ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=must%20be%20the%20final%20end,is%20the%20principle%20of%20all)). This may sound grandiose, but in Aquinas’s metaphysics it fits: the universe’s purpose is fulfilled in the intellect’s contemplation of God, the First Truth. In fact, he goes on to say that *both* aspects of being wise – contemplating truth *and* refuting error – apply preeminently to theology. The wise person “studies and speaks out the truth of God” and “impugns error contrary to truth” ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=It%20is%20one%20and%20the,lips%20shall%20detest%20the%20ungodly)). (Medieval intellectual life could be combative – Aquinas wasn’t writing in a troll-free zone, after all. He had to contend with everything from Averroist philosophers to roving heretics, hence the polemical edge.)

One of Aquinas’s more charming methods is how he bolsters his arguments with authorities. In discussing God’s nature, we find him quoting everything from Aristotle’s *Metaphysics* to the Book of Exodus (“I AM WHO AM”) to obscure statements by saints. In *Contra Gentiles*, he even cites the Qur’an respectfully when arguing for God’s attributes (in a chapter addressing Muslims’ beliefs). This breadth of sources is deliberate: Aquinas wants to show that reason and revelation, Eastern Church Fathers and Western Doctors, all converge on the reality of the one God – if properly understood. In fact, in **_Adversus Errores Graecorum_** (“Against the Errors of the Greeks”), a treatise addressed to the Pope about Greek Orthodox misunderstandings, Aquinas takes an irenic approach. Despite the combative title, the work “contains nothing directed against the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church” per se, but rather defends Latin teachings using Greek authorities ([Contra Errores Graecorum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_Errores_Graecorum#:~:text=The%20title%20of%20the%20treatise,3)). Aquinas patiently explains that many East-West disputes are verbal or cultural. For example, Greek theologians said the Father is the “cause” (*aitia*) of the Son, language Latin theologians avoided because calling the Father a *cause* sounds like making the Son an effect or a different substance ([Contra Errores Graecorum - St. Thomas Aquinas](https://web.archive.org/web/20080509054823/http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/errorgre.htm#:~:text=true%20God%2C%20although%20his%20principle,And%20this%20for%20three%20reasons)) ([Contra Errores Graecorum - St. Thomas Aquinas](https://web.archive.org/web/20080509054823/http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/errorgre.htm#:~:text=the%20Father%20is%20the%20cause,And%20this%20for%20three%20reasons)). Aquinas clarifies: the Greeks mean cause in terms of principle, not as a maker different from the made. “Among the Latins it is not customary to say that the Father is the cause of the Son or of the Holy Spirit, but solely the principle or originator… lest the Son be understood to be of another essence than the Father” ([Contra Errores Graecorum - St. Thomas Aquinas](https://web.archive.org/web/20080509054823/http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/errorgre.htm#:~:text=the%20Father%20is%20the%20cause,And%20this%20for%20three%20reasons)). Likewise, he notes that Greeks comfortably speak of *three hypostases* in God, whereas Latins prefer *three persons* – because in Latin, *hypostasis* translates to *substantia*, and calling God three substances would be heretical ([Contra Errores Graecorum - St. Thomas Aquinas](https://web.archive.org/web/20080509054823/http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/errorgre.htm#:~:text=Second%2C%20because%20many%20terms%20which,say%20three%20persons%2C%20as%20Augustine)). These nuanced clarifications show Aquinas the diplomat of doctrine, carefully translating concepts across linguistic divides: “when the Greeks say three hypostases, we say three persons” ([Contra Errores Graecorum - St. Thomas Aquinas](https://web.archive.org/web/20080509054823/http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/errorgre.htm#:~:text=in%20accordance%20with%20the%20Catholic,duty%20of%20a%20good%20translator)). In modern terms, he’s doing a bit of theological *cross-platform compatibility* work – ensuring everyone’s on the same page about the Trinity and avoiding semantic bugs that could crash the system of ecumenical dialogue.

Throughout his discourse on God, Aquinas maintains a tone of almost dry sobriety, but occasionally one senses a kind of awe behind the academic prose. After proving God’s existence, he essentially says: *Now that we know God exists, we have to admit that many truths about God exceed what reason can demonstrate* ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=BECAUSE%20not%20every%20truth%20admits,of%20the%20light%20of%20natural)) ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=doctrine%20of%20the%20Philosopher%2C%20that,objects%20beyond%20sense%20cannot%20be)). For instance, the Trinity cannot be proved by natural reason, only accepted by faith ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=Nicom,matter%20is%20an)). This acknowledgment of mystery doesn’t destabilize his project; it actually properly frames it. Aquinas is building a stairway of reason as high as it can go, but he knows the top rungs reach into clouds that human intellect can’t penetrate unaided. *“The truths we confess concerning God fall under two modes,”* he writes: some (like God’s existence and unity) are demonstrable by reason, others (like the Trinity) are *“beyond all the competence of human reason”* ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=BECAUSE%20not%20every%20truth%20admits,of%20the%20light%20of%20natural)). A “well-educated man,” Aquinas quotes Aristotle, seeks only the degree of precision a subject allows ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=BECAUSE%20not%20every%20truth%20admits,of%20the%20light%20of%20natural)). So Aquinas doesn’t try to *prove* the Trinity or the Incarnation; rather, he uses reason to show such mysteries are not *impossible* or self-contradictory, and to elucidate their meaning. Faith and reason thus collaborate in Aquinas’s system – distinct but harmonious. As the Stanford *Encyclopedia of Philosophy* notes, he had a “firm conviction… that the Christian faith could only benefit from a profound engagement with philosophy and science” ([
Thomas Aquinas (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#:~:text=match%20at%20L102%20of%20the,engagement%20with%20philosophy%20and%20science)). In general, Aquinas strives mightily “to harmonize the faith with the mainstream of philosophical opinion” ([
Thomas Aquinas (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#:~:text=governing%20form%20of%20Aristotelianism%2C%20drawn,causal%20determinism%20as%20applied%20to)). If that means tweaking Aristotle here or there, so be it. “Thomas Aquinas’s system, however, was by no means simply Aristotle Christianized,” the *Britannica* reminds us; *“he did not hesitate to differ from ‘the Philosopher’… when the Christian tradition required this”* ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=Thomas%20Aquinas%E2%80%99s%20system%2C%20however%2C%20was,to%20explain%20why%20it%20exists)). Aristotle sought the how of the world; Thomas insisted on asking the why ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=Thomas%20Aquinas%E2%80%99s%20system%2C%20however%2C%20was,to%20explain%20why%20it%20exists)). Nowhere is this clearer than in his treatment of God as the purposeful Creator – a theme we turn to next.

## III. Creation, Providence, and the Problem of Evil  
Having established God as the necessary self-existing Being, Aquinas proceeds to explain the relationship between this God and everything else. In Aquinas’s world-picture, creation isn’t a one-time event but an ongoing relationship of dependency – if God were *not* continually giving existence, creatures would relapse into nothingness in an instant ([
Thomas Aquinas (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#:~:text=existed,be%20committed%20to%20the%20latter)). God is like the sun continuously illuminating the world; creatures are like moons that shine only by borrowed light. This emphasis on *continual creation* or *conservation* was a significant development of the medieval scholastics. Aquinas, with characteristic clarity, says that *every action of every creature depends on God’s action more intimately than on the creature’s own power* ([
Thomas Aquinas (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#:~:text=existed,be%20committed%20to%20the%20latter)). (His later followers debated exactly how – spawning the thorny doctrine of *premotion* – but we’ll not digress into that scholastic briar patch).

Aquinas also tackles the classic question: *Why did God create at all?* Not out of need or compulsion, but out of generosity. Goodness is diffusive of itself; bonum est diffusivum sui. In the *Quaestiones Disputatae De Potentia Dei* (Disputed Questions on the Power of God), Aquinas writes: *“I answer that it is in the nature of every act to communicate itself as far as possible… Now the divine nature is supreme and most pure act; wherefore it communicates itself as far as possible”* ([Thomas Aquinas: Quaestiones Disputatae de Potentia: English](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdePotentia.htm#:~:text=,most%20pure%20act%3A%20wherefore%20it)). In other words, because God is Pure Act and infinite perfection, it befits His goodness to overflow into creation. Aquinas echoes the idea (from Dionysius the Areopagite) that God’s goodness wasn’t something He’d keep to Himself. Like a wise Gen Z content creator, God didn’t create for *clout* (He already had all the glory), but to share the love. Creation is a free gift. Aquinas even entertained, as a thought experiment, that an eternal creation is *metaphysically* possible (God could have been creating from all eternity) – but based on divine revelation he accepts the world had a beginning in time. The key point is, whether beginning or eternal, creation’s existence is entirely from God’s fiat and continues in God’s governance.

This brings us to providence and the thorny problem of evil. If a supremely good and omnipotent God made everything, why is there evil in the world? Aquinas approaches this systematically in his *De Malo* (“On Evil”) and in sections of the *Summa*. He doesn’t shy away from the tough questions: is evil a *thing*? Is God the cause of evil? Can there be an “infinite” evil? His answer to the ontology of evil is firmly in the Augustinian privation camp: evil is *not* an independent substance or a positive entity, but a lack of good – a privation of due order in something. “We speak of evil in two ways,” Aquinas writes, drawing an analogy to color: just as “white” can mean either the *subject* that is white or the *quality* of whiteness, so “evil” can mean an evil thing (like a bad person) or the evil *itself* (the badness in an act or state) ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=We%20speak%20of%20evil%20in,particular%20good%2C%20not%20an%20entity)). If we speak of evil *itself*, “evil so understood is the very privation of a particular good, not an entity” ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=understand%20the%20subject%20that%20is,particular%20good%2C%20not%20an%20entity)). In a striking line, Aquinas declares: *“evil is necessarily what is contrary to the desirable as such. And what is contrary to the desirable as such cannot be an entity”* ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=And%20to%20prove%20this%2C%20we,is%20evident%20for%20three%20reasons)). Goodness, by definition, is being *as desirable*; evil, being the negation of that, has no positive ontological content of its own. It’s like a hole in reality – you can’t pick up a hole and throw it at someone. Evil exists, in a sense, but only as a parasite on goodness. “Evil can only be in good,” Aquinas notes ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=Answer%3A%20Evil%20can%20only%20be,particular%20thing%20good%2C%20as%2C%20for)). A rotting apple is evil (bad) because the good of health in the apple’s flesh is corrupted; the rot is not a new “substance,” just the decay of a substance. Even moral evil (sin) is the privation of due order in the will – a good faculty failing to attain its proper good.

Okay, so evil is a privation. But did God *cause* this privation? Directly, no. God is the cause of all *being*, but privation, as such, is not a being – it’s an *anti-being* of sorts. Aquinas painstakingly explains that while God is the cause of every positive reality (including the natural actions of creatures, which can result in evil incidentally), He is not the cause of the *lack* in those actions. For example, when a creature with a free will chooses wrongly, God causes the will’s act of choosing (as the primary cause empowering secondary causes), but the *defect* – the disorder in that choice – comes from the creature, not from God ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=Answer%3A%20The%20cause%20of%20evil,First%2C%20effects)). This is subtle, perhaps akin to saying: the sun illuminates both healthy plants and withered plants, but the withering comes from a lack (water, nutrients) in the plant, not from the sun. In Aquinas’s words, “the cause of evil is good, in the way in which evil can have a cause,” but that is always an incidental and not intrinsic cause ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=Answer%3A%20The%20cause%20of%20evil,First%2C%20effects)). No one *intends* evil as evil; an evildoer always seeks some perceived good (power, pleasure, etc.) and it’s the disorder of means or circumstances that constitutes the evil. God, being all-good, never directly causes that disorder. He merely permits it in view of a greater good – a classic doctrine of providence.

Aquinas’s treatment of evil is perhaps one of the most philosophically satisfying in the Christian tradition, though some skeptics might roll their eyes at privation theory (to them, evil can feel awfully *real*). Even Aquinas acknowledges the emotional weight: evil is not an illusion, it’s a real privation that causes real suffering. His stoic scholastic language doesn’t exactly console the weeping Job, but it provides a framework in which one can say: *God is light, and darkness isn’t a positive thing created by God but the result of creatures turning away from that light.* And because it’s a privation, evil never gets the last word – it has no independent *being* to triumph with. Here Aquinas’s optimism shows: all being as being is good (*bonum diffusivum sui* again), and evil is always secondary, parasitic, and ultimately self-defeating. Even the devil, in Aquinas’s view, has a nature created good; his evil is the misuse and lack within that nature. It’s a bit like a cosmic math: Good is +1, Evil is –1; no matter how many -1s you have, they only exist by subtracting from the +1s. (Gen Z translation: Evil is the glitch in the Matrix, not the code itself.)

From creation and evil, Aquinas naturally transitions to discuss providence, divine governance, and the final end of creatures. He insists that human free will is real and compatible with God’s sovereignty – a reconciliation he achieves by a robust concept of primary and secondary causality. God’s causation doesn’t compete with ours; it enables it. “God works in all things,” Aquinas says, yet in accord with their nature: in necessary causes He works necessarily, in contingent causes contingently ([Thomas Aquinas: Quaestiones Disputatae de Potentia: English](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdePotentia.htm#:~:text=,naturally%20desires%2C%E2%80%94thus%20a%20man%E2%80%99s%20will)). Thus, when we freely choose, it is truly our choice, but also underlain by God’s causal action as the source of our will and its efficacy. (If your brain is starting to feel the scholastic burn, you’re not alone – even Aquinas’s later commentators split hairs over this for centuries.)

An interesting aspect of Aquinas’s worldview is how *positive* it is about creation’s goodness and order. Influenced by Aristotle, he sees the world as intelligible and governed by divine reason (the *lex aeterna* or eternal law). The famous *Treatise on Law* in the *Summa* (I-II, Q90–97) describes how God’s eternal law (basically, His plan or providence) is imprinted on creatures. Rational creatures participate in eternal law through the *natural law* – that built-in moral compass or inclination to goodness ([Aquinas](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q91.A2.C#:~:text=ways%3A%20in%20one%20way%2C%20as,Reason%2C%20whereby%20it%20has%20a)) ([Aquinas](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q91.A2.C#:~:text=natural%20inclination%20to%20its%20proper,ergo%20dicendum%20quod%20ratio%20illa)). “The natural law is nothing else than the rational creature’s participation of the eternal law,” Aquinas writes ([Aquinas](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q91.A2.C#:~:text=things%3F%20in%20answer%20to%20which,ergo%20dicendum%20quod%20ratio%20illa)). Just as all things follow the laws of their nature (stones fall, fire burns), human beings have an inner law keyed to reason and the pursuit of good and avoidance of evil. Our conscience, our understanding that virtues are to be practiced and life preserved, etc., are all reflections of God’s eternal wisdom instilled in us. Aquinas practically baptizes Aristotle’s ethics here, wedding it to a theology of divine government. 

But reason alone, Aquinas admits, isn’t sufficient for humans to reach our ultimate end. Hence the need for *divine law* in the form of revelation – notably the Old Law (Torah) and the New Law (Gospel). Divine law directs us to our supernatural end (eternal happiness with God) in a way natural law cannot on its own ([Thomas Aquinas on Law](https://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/302/aquinlaw.htm#:~:text=Thomas%20Aquinas%20on%20Law%20Divine,human%20beings%20as%20divine)) ([7.4.3: Natural Law Theory - Humanities LibreTexts](https://human.libretexts.org/Courses/Folsom_Lake_College/PHIL_300%3A_Introduction_to_Philosophy_(Bauer)/07%3A_Ethics/7.04%3A_Aquinass_Nstural_Law_Theory/7.4.03%3A_Natural_Law_Theory#:~:text=Natural%20Law%2C%20Human%20Law%20and,Divine%20Law)). It also addresses things our human reason might miss or get wrong due to sin. “Unaided human reason cannot apprehend the whole of eternal law. Thus, divine law is also a reflection of the eternal law” as one summary puts it ([What Can We Learn from a Catholic Thinker? Aquinas and Natural ...](https://www.str.org/w/what-can-we-learn-from-a-catholic-thinker-aquinas-and-natural-law#:~:text=What%20Can%20We%20Learn%20from,a%20reflection%20of%20the)). In Aquinas’s architecture, therefore, there is a beautiful order: Eternal Law (in God’s mind) -> impresses Natural Law (in creatures, especially rational ones) -> and is supplemented by Revealed Divine Law -> and then we make Human Law (civil laws, etc.) in accordance with natural law. Each level should ideally flow from the higher. If a human law contradicts natural law, it’s not a true law but a “perversion of law,” Aquinas boldly says. This hierarchy of laws has inspired centuries of discussions on justice and rights. (It’s not hard to see Aquinas’s influence on, say, the U.S. Declaration of Independence’s appeal to “Laws of Nature and Nature’s God”. The Angelic Doctor inadvertently became an intellectual founding father, one might jest.)

Aquinas thus has a confident view that creation, even though marred by evil and sin, is fundamentally ordered by God toward good ends. Providence can draw good even out of evil – a bad action might occasion patience or justice or repentance, in the grand scheme. In the *Summa*, Aquinas famously asserts that God’s permission of evil is part of His providence, because He is able to bring a greater good from it (for instance, He permits sins to manifest His mercy in forgiveness or His justice in punishment) ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=And%20to%20prove%20this%2C%20we,is%20evident%20for%20three%20reasons)) ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=First%2C%20it%20is%20evident%20because,an%20end%20and%20some%20good)). The cross of Christ is, for Aquinas, the ultimate example: the worst moral evil (deicide) becomes the path to the greatest good (redemption). This is not to say evil isn’t evil – only that it doesn’t derail God’s plan. It’s a detour at most, which the divine GPS (Grace Positioning System?) reroutes to the same destination. Aquinas’s optimism here might sound almost naïve to modern ears scarred by world wars and atrocities, but it is grounded in his metaphysics: since being is good and God is in charge, non-being (evil) can never have the final say. It’s metaphysically *absurd* for Nothing to win out over Something. That’s a thought as comforting as it is philosophically intriguing.

## IV. The Human Soul: Form and Immortality in the Synthesis  
Aquinas is thoroughly Aristotelian in his philosophical anthropology: the human being is a composite of soul (*anima*) and body, where the soul is the *forma corporis* (form of the body). This means the soul is not a separate “ghost in the machine” but the intrinsic principle that makes the matter of the body a living human. In a literal sense, your soul is what makes *you* – organizing your material components into one being with life, sensation, and rationality. Aquinas staunchly defends that “the soul is the act of a physical organic body which has life potentially” ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=that%20,the%20body%20precedes%20the%20soul)), endorsing Aristotle’s definition from *De Anima*. Therefore, the soul relates to the body as form to matter: together they compose one substance (one *essence* of human) ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=that%20,the%20body%20precedes%20the%20soul)) ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L1100%20Reply%20to,its%20primary%20and%20proportionate%20perfectible)). He rejects Platonic dualism that treats soul and body as two independent substances loosely connected. If the intellect were *not* the form of the body, he argues, then a human (like Socrates) would not be one being but two loosely allied beings – an unacceptable conclusion ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=Secondly%2C%20because%20since%20Socrates%20,is%20moved%20by%20his%20intellect)) ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=Fourthly%2C%20because%2C%20although%20the%20action,according%20as%20it%20is%20one)). “It follows that Socrates is not one absolutely, and consequently neither a being absolutely, for a thing is a being according as it is one” he notes bluntly ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=because%20the%20eye%20sees,according%20as%20it%20is%20one)). In other words, if the soul were just a mover of the body, Socrates would be a *team* (an intellect plus a body), not a single unified man. And that’s metaphysically messy.

That said, Aquinas holds a nuanced position that the human soul *is* capable of subsisting apart from the body (after death) due to its spiritual operations (intellect and will) which do not depend on bodily organs. So while body and soul normally function as one unit, the rational soul has the unique feature of being able to exist in an immaterial state – which is why Aquinas can affirm personal immortality. He performs some intricate analysis to get here: since the intellect grasps universals (not just particulars) and can reflect on abstract concepts, it cannot be a bodily organ (no organ deals in universals) ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=Reply%20to%20Objection%201,is%20called%20the%20act%2C%20the)). Therefore the intellect is an immaterial power, and the human soul, as the seat of intellect, must itself be immaterial in aspect. An immaterial form is not automatically annihilated when separated from matter (as material forms are). Hence when the body dies, the human soul continues to exist and to exercise intellectual and volitional acts (though in an “unnatural” state of separation, awaiting reunion with the body at the resurrection). Aquinas describes the separated soul not as a complete human (it’s a “part” of the human, technically) but as an incomplete substance that nevertheless can operate by God’s ordination in the interim ([How is the human soul both the form (i.e. a universal) for the body ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicPhilosophy/comments/1bi7hze/how_is_the_human_soul_both_the_form_ie_a/#:~:text=How%20is%20the%20human%20soul,since%20it%27s%20not%20complete)). The soul without the body is “not a person, since it’s not complete,” as he clarifies, but it retains personal identity in anticipation of being clothed again in the resurrected body ([How is the human soul both the form (i.e. a universal) for the body ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicPhilosophy/comments/1bi7hze/how_is_the_human_soul_both_the_form_ie_a/#:~:text=How%20is%20the%20human%20soul,since%20it%27s%20not%20complete)).

All this might sound heavily philosophical, but it had real theological stakes in Aquinas’s time – debates raged about the nature of the soul, especially with Averroist philosophers in Paris claiming there was one universal intellect for all humans (yikes, collective mind!). Aquinas went to great lengths to refute the “monopsychism” of Averroës, insisting on the individuality of each soul and its direct creation by God (no traducianism for him – each soul is a fresh creation, not transmitted by parents). He even wrote an entire work, *De Unitate Intellectus contra Averroistas*, to settle that score.

In practical terms, Aquinas presents a vision of the human person as a balanced unity: we are rational animals, our rationality elevating us beyond beasts, and our animality grounding us in the tangible world. He respects the body enormously – the resurrection of the body is a key Christian doctrine he upholds, and philosophically he sees the body as integral to human nature. “The soul and body together form one human nature, of which the soul and body are parts,” he asserts in line with the scholastic axiom that *anima forma corporis* ([The body and soul together form one human nature, of which the ...](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/the-body-and-soul-together-form-one-human-nature-of-which-the-soul-and-body-are-parts-thomas-aquin--602286150179234817/#:~:text=...%20in.pinterest.com%20%20,Twitter)). This hylomorphic (matter-form) view allowed Aquinas to synthesize Aristotelian biology with Christian theology of the afterlife. It does result in some complex metaphysics for the interim state of the soul, but Aquinas was content to admit it’s a temporary imperfection – the soul longs to be reunited with body, as a bird longs for its nest.

On the psychological side, Aquinas’s model of the soul includes vegetative, sensitive, and rational powers (following Aristotle). He analyzes in detail how sense perception works, how imagination (the “phantasy”) provides the intellect with phantasms to abstract universal concepts from ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=Aristotle%20%20proceeds%20to%20consider,Socrates%2C%20in%20whom%20are%20the)), and how the will tends toward the good the intellect presents. One can admire the thoroughness: by the time he’s done, Aquinas has a mini-compendium of psychology that wouldn’t be out of place in a neuroscience textbook (minus the Latin and the assumption that intellect is immaterial – points on which contemporary neuroscience might swipe left). 

In ethics (more on that soon), this anthropology undergirds virtue theory: virtues perfect the powers of the soul (some virtues perfect the intellect, others the will/appetites). Passions (emotions) are part of the sensitive soul and are morally neutral in themselves but can be shaped by reason and will – hence *virtus* in Latin implies strength to govern one’s passions rightly. Aquinas, contrary to some misconceptions, does not despise the emotions; he classifies and appreciates them (love, desire, joy, hope, fear, anger, etc.) as arising from our nature, to be guided by reason and oriented toward good.

In a lighter vein, one might say Aquinas’s view of the soul avoids making us either pure angels (too lofty to need bodies) or mere animals (slaves to instinct). We’re rational animals, a hybrid – think of a centaur but with the halves fully fused into one being. And indeed, Aquinas sees *angelic* beings as a different order altogether: pure intellects created by God, each an individual species of its own (since no matter to differentiate individuals of the same form). His angelology in the *Summa* is famously meticulous: angels have no bodies, they are immortal by nature, they can influence matter, they have their own hierarchy and receive illumination from God and higher angels, etc. Fascinatingly, he even speculates on how angels communicate (not by speech, obviously, but by telepathic illumination of concepts). Why digress into angels? Because for Aquinas, understanding pure spirits sheds light by contrast on the embodied spirit of man. We’re a middle creature: below angels in the hierarchy of being (due to our material limitation), but above animals and plants (due to our intellective soul). It’s the classic *Great Chain of Being* image, which Aquinas inherited and refashioned: from God to angels to humans to animals to plants to minerals. Each level reflects the one above in diminishing degree. Human beings uniquely touch both the spiritual and material realms – we are the cosmic amphibians.

This grand synthesis yields a rather optimistic humanism. Unlike some earlier theologians who emphasized human depravity or the insignificance of earthly life, Aquinas (influenced by Aristotle’s focus on the here-and-now) affirms the dignity of our natural powers. True, he knows *grace* is needed for the supernatural end, and original sin has wounded our nature – he isn’t Pelagian. Yet he famously said grace *“does not destroy nature but perfects it”*. Our ability to reason, to make art, to love in natural ways, all find fulfillment rather than negation in Aquinas’s Christianity. It’s a very **incarnational** outlook: God works through our nature (just as the Word took human nature). 

In sum, Aquinas’s portrait of the soul is like an elegantly coded algorithm for human behavior – body and soul integrating sensory data and intellectual insight, passions under the governance of virtuous reason, free will choosing the good perceived by the mind, and all under the gentle motion of divine providence. If that sounds a bit too good to be true, Aquinas would remind us that *virtue* is needed to actually harmonize these elements in practice. Without virtue, the soul’s powers pull apart: reason may be duped, appetites may rebel, will may fix on false goods. So let’s turn to his moral theory, where the rubber meets the road (or the soul meets the goal, if you like scholastic rhymes).

## V. Virtue, Law, and the Drama of Human Action  
Aquinas’s ethics is often dubbed *virtue ethics*, but it’s really a rich blend of virtue theory, natural law, and a teleological framework of human flourishing. In the *Secunda Pars* of the *Summa Theologica*, he takes the reader on a tour-de-force through human acts, passions, habits, virtues, vices, law, and grace. One can imagine him as a kind of moral architect here – mapping out the blueprint of the good life. But lest we think it’s all ivory-tower musings, Aquinas anchors everything in the ultimate end (happiness in union with God) and the practical reasoning we use to get there (conscience, law, virtue). He was, in modern terms, quite *goal-oriented* – but the goal is nothing less than beatitudo, true happiness or blessedness, which for Aquinas consists in the vision of the divine essence in the next life (a goal only achievable by God’s grace), and in a foretaste of that happiness through virtuous living and knowing God imperfectly here.

Let’s break it down. Aquinas defines *virtue* as a habitual and firm disposition to do the good. He’s adapting Aristotle’s idea that virtue is a habitus (a stable character trait) that lies in a mean relative to us, determined by reason. But Aquinas extends the concept with the theological virtues (Faith, Hope, Charity) which have God as their direct object and come *from* God as gifts. The cardinal virtues (Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance) organize the human aspects of our life. Prudence perfects the intellect to discern the right course; justice perfects the will in giving others their due; fortitude and temperance perfect our irascible and concupiscible appetites (courage in difficulties, moderation in pleasures). Each virtue then branches into sub-virtues, and Aquinas catalogs them like a botanist of the soul.

One star of the show is **charity (caritas)**, the love of God above all and love of neighbor for God’s sake. In the *Quaestio Disputata De Caritate* (On Charity), Aquinas engages deeply with what charity really is. At one point he entertains an objection that charity might not be a created habit in the soul at all, but simply the Holy Spirit working in us without any created intermediary ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=,habit%2C%20as%20is%20clear%20in)) ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=Book%20I%2C%20dist,)). He ultimately rejects that view, concluding that charity *is* a created virtue infused by God. But what’s beautiful is how Aquinas describes charity: as *friendship* with God. Echoing Aristotle’s notion of friendship, he says charity is a kind of *amicitia* between God and man ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=is%20needed%20to%20unite%20us,numbered%20among%20the%20theological%20virtues)). Now, one might object (as indeed he records): how can there be friendship between vastly unequal partners – the infinite God and puny humans? “Friendship consists in a certain equality,” the objection goes, and we are anything but equal to God ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=friendship%20consists%20in%20a%20certain,Moreover)). Aquinas replies that the equality in question is established by God’s gracious condescension – God raises us up to a share in the divine life, which establishes the communion needed for friendship ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=,able%20are%20we%20to%20love)). Charity, therefore, is *the most perfect friendship*, he says, one that “extends itself to God and to all who are able to know God” ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=inasmuch%20as%20friendship%20towards%20one,able%20are%20we%20to%20love)). It even includes our enemies, because our love of God makes us will the good (ultimately salvation) to all others as creatures made to know Him ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L1115%20others,know%2C%20but%20also%20our%20enemies)). This is a wonderful example of Aquinas using a human philosophical concept (friendship) to illuminate a theological virtue. He effectively sanctifies Aristotle’s notion that a true friend is *another self*, applying it to God’s love shed in our hearts.

Aquinas also deals with the dynamic of growth in charity (it can increase), loss of charity (through mortal sin), and how charity informs and shapes all other virtues (no act is truly meritorious of eternal life unless animated by charity, since only love for God orders us immediately to our supernatural end). In a sense, charity is the blueprint’s capstone – the final touch that holds the whole moral edifice together in Aquinas’s view. Without charity, you could have someone who is prudent, brave, just, temperate for selfish or natural motives, but it won’t achieve the ultimate finality of union with God. With charity, even small acts – giving a cup of water to someone thirsty, for instance – become imbued with divine significance (“done to the least of my brethren, done to Me,” as Christ said).

Alongside virtue, Aquinas’s moral theory emphasizes *law* as a guide for free will. We already touched on eternal, natural, human, and divine law. Aquinas famously defines law as “an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated” (ST I-II Q90 A4). This rational and common-good oriented definition reflects his view that law should educate and direct people to virtue, not just coerce them. The natural law’s first precept, he says, is that good is to be done and pursued, and evil avoided – all other precepts flow from this ([Aquinas](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q91.A2.C#:~:text=which%20is%20ruled%20and%20measured%2C,Reason%2C%20whereby%20it%20has%20a)) ([Aquinas](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q91.A2.C#:~:text=others,the%20function%20of%20the%20natural)). Secondary precepts include things like preserve life, reproduce and educate offspring, know truth about God, live in society – all of which Aquinas sees as rooted in human inclinations. The elegance is that morality isn’t arbitrarily imposed; it’s built into what we *are*. So when we act against natural law (say, commit perjury or murder), we’re actually acting against our own deepest good and rational nature. Aquinas might drop a sly Gen Z analogy here: *violating natural law is like using a smartphone to hammer nails – sure, you *can* do it, but it’s a dumb use of the device and you’ll probably break it.* Living immorally is misusing the splendid “device” of our humanity.

One particularly interesting application of law in Aquinas is the idea of **conscience** (which he calls *synderesis* for the habitual knowledge of principles and *conscientia* for the act of applying them). He acknowledges that conscience can err, and that we are obliged to follow even an erroneous conscience if we have no way to correct it – though if the error was our fault (through negligence in seeking the truth), we might still be culpable. This nuanced analysis shows Aquinas’s commitment to the primacy of reason in moral life, yet tempered by the understanding of human fallibility.

The *drama* of human action, for Aquinas, lies in the interplay of intellect, will, passions, habits, and external influences – and ultimately grace. We haven’t even mentioned grace yet, but in the *Treatise on Grace* (ST I-II Q109–114), Aquinas makes it abundantly clear that no one can attain the ultimate end or even begin to turn to God in faith and charity without the prevenient and cooperative grace of God. He navigates between Pelagianism (earning salvation by works) and Protestant-like monergism by asserting both total dependence on grace and the genuine freedom/cooperation of the human will moved by grace. Grace perfects nature: an empowered will can now seek God supernaturally, and infused virtues elevate even our moral life to a higher order. Thus, the virtuous life of a Christian is not just Aristotle’s *flourishing man* who reasons well and acts moderately; it’s a person in whom Christ lives through charity and whose ultimate exemplar is not an ancient Greek hero but the God-Man Himself.

Still, Aquinas has immense respect for the ethical insights of the ancients. In one lovely passage, he says that the moral virtues *conduce* to a happiness attainable in this life – an imperfect happiness, but happiness nonetheless – whereas the theological virtues orient us to perfect happiness in heaven ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=thinkers%2C%20St,to%20which%20statements%20about%20God)) ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=conception%20of%20metaphysics%20as%20the,the%20%E2%80%9Cform%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20body)). He thereby validates the whole enterprise of pursuing virtue for a fulfilling life here (eudaimonia, to use Aristotle’s term), even while saying, in effect, “But wait, there’s more – an eternal beatitude beyond your wildest dreams.” It’s not an either/or; it’s a harmonious stacking of human and divine goods.

To give a concrete flavor: consider Aquinas on *justice*. Justice is giving each their due. Aquinas explores types of justice – commutative (between individuals, e.g. fair exchange), distributive (what the community owes individuals, e.g. honors, resources according to merit/need), legal (what the individual owes the community). He upholds that property rights are legitimate (against radical Franciscans who flirted with absolute poverty as a higher ideal) but also insists that in cases of necessity all goods are common – the starving can legitimately take what they need to survive (a scenario nowadays sometimes invoked as a right to basic sustenance). On *war*, he outlines just war conditions (legitimate authority, just cause, right intention), basically formulating principles that remain influential to this day in international law discussions. On *sex and marriage*, as one might expect of a medieval theologian, he holds traditional views (sex only within marriage and open to life, etc.), but he presents them with a blend of biological reasoning and the idea of fostering friendship between spouses. Indeed, he says one of the goods of marriage is the mutual *fides* (faithful friendship) of the spouses – a very humanistic appreciation of marital love, not purely a procreative contract. One might playfully imagine Aquinas dropping a hint that marriage is like a little society bound by charity – a friendship that images Christ and the Church.

A particularly poignant part of Aquinas’s moral exposition is his handling of the **passions**. Far from telling us to suppress or disdain emotions, he sees them as material for virtue. For example, *mercy* (misericordia) is technically a passion (a movement of compassion in the appetite at another’s misery) elevated by charity into a virtuous action of helping the other. Aquinas even states that mercy is the greatest virtue insofar as it denotes action (since it’s God’s own mode of showing goodness to creatures in misery) – only charity, which unites us to God, is greater absolutely ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=,friendship%2C%20and%20neither%20is%20charity)) ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=special%20love,special%20good%20as%20its%20proper)). This warms the scholastic outline with a bit of affective color: Aquinas, often caricatured as a brainy logician, deeply values tenderness and empathy as reflections of divine love.

It’s worth noting a touch of Aquinas’s Gen Z compatible humor: While he doesn’t crack jokes in the *Summa*, there is a famous question (ST II-II Q168 A4) where he asks if there’s a virtue about games and play. He answers yes – the virtue of eutrapelia (wittiness or good fun) – because just as the body needs rest, the soul needs relaxation, and humor can be virtuous if it’s done in moderation and kindness. He even warns against being too strict and joyless: *“Just as it is against reason to behave inordinately in play, so too it is against reason to be burdensome to others, not affording them any pleasure and to oppose any kind of play”* (imagine him telling some dour monk, “Lighten up, brother!”). So Aquinas affirms a place for humor and play in a well-lived life ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=called%20him%2C%20when%20the%20Christian,to%20explain%20why%20it%20exists)) ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=had%20been%20concerned%20to%20understand,to%20explain%20why%20it%20exists)). Perhaps he’d smile upon a bit of clever humor in an essay like this – so long as it edifies rather than distracts.

## VI. Synthesis and Wisdom: Faith and Reason United  
By now it’s clear that Aquinas’s thought is *systematic* – each part connecting to others – yet also adventurous in its synthesis. He was one of those scholars who read everything available: Aristotle, Plato (indirectly via Augustine and others), the Bible, the Church Fathers, Muslim and Jewish philosophers (Averroës, Avicenna, Maimonides), and even his contemporaries whom he often disagreed with (like the aforementioned Latin Averroists or the radical Franciscans or the Cathar heretics). His genius was in integrating truths from all sides into a coherent whole, like a grand intellectual potluck where everyone’s best dish is welcome. One historian aptly notes that Aquinas *“embraced several ideas put forward by Aristotle and attempted to synthesize Aristotelian philosophy with the principles of Christianity”* ([Thomas Aquinas - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#:~:text=Thomas%20Aquinas%20,Aquinas)). This was not done uncritically: where Aristotle clashed with Christian doctrine (e.g. the eternity of the world, or the denial of individual providence), Aquinas modified or rejected the Aristotelian position ([Christianity - Aristotle, Aquinas, Faith | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Aristotle-and-Aquinas#:~:text=Thomas%20Aquinas%E2%80%99s%20system%2C%20however%2C%20was,to%20explain%20why%20it%20exists)). But he saw far more harmony than discord between natural reason and Christian faith. 

The result of his labors, especially in the *Summa Theologica*, is often called the **Thomistic synthesis**. It’s a synthesis not just of Aristotle and the Bible, but of the whole medieval intellectual inheritance: including Roman legal ideas (in his concept of law), Pseudo-Dionysian mysticism (in his hierarchy of angels and participation metaphysics), Augustinian inwardness (in his emphasis on will and grace), and more. Aquinas basically tried to give each field of human knowledge its due place under the sun of theology. Like an architect co-ordinating different teams (masons, carpenters, glaziers), he coordinated disciplines: philosophy builds the foundation and scaffolding; scripture provides the design plan; theology (using both) erects the final structure pointing to heaven. He famously said that *all truth is one*, because all truth ultimately comes from God. Therefore, any truth found in pagan philosophers or non-Christian sources can and should be appropriated into the larger edifice of Christian wisdom ([
Thomas Aquinas (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#:~:text=of%20the%20Aristotelian%20corpus%20in,engagement%20with%20philosophy%20and%20science)). This attitude, radical in his age, is why we find him calling even Muslim thinkers “the Philosopher” or “the Commentator” with respect: a good idea is a good idea, regardless of its origin, because truth is God’s wherever it’s found.

This intellectual openness combined with firm doctrinal commitment is Aquinas’s secret sauce. It allowed him to be a *summit* of medieval thought, as one scholar put it: *“Viewed through a theological lens, Aquinas has often been seen as the summit of the Christian tradition that runs back to Augustine… Viewed as a philosopher, he is a foundational figure of modern thought”* ([
Thomas Aquinas (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#:~:text=the%20era%2C%20philosophy%20and%20theology%2C,later%20medieval%20and%20modern%20philosophers)). Indeed, by reworking Aristotelianism systematically, he “reshaped Western philosophy” and influenced even secular thinking ([
Thomas Aquinas (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#:~:text=the%20era%2C%20philosophy%20and%20theology%2C,later%20medieval%20and%20modern%20philosophers)). For instance, his ideas about natural law influenced the development of human rights theory; his logic and epistemology prefigured aspects of modern analytic philosophy’s concerns with language and meaning (recent scholarship has even probed Aquinas’s semantic theories for insights on analogy and reference). 

However, Aquinas always saw himself primarily as a theologian serving the Church. The *Summa* was written *“for the instruction of beginners”* in theology ([Aquinas](https://aquinas.cc/#:~:text=quae%20ad%20Christianam%20religionem%20pertinent%2C,quaestionum%2C%20articulorum%20et%20argumentorum%3B%20partim)) – which is almost laughable given its depth, but he meant to synthesize and simplify the sprawling, repetitive scholastic debates into an organized, teachable format. Yet, ironically, the *Summa* remained unfinished; Aquinas stopped writing after a mystical experience in December 1273, after which he famously said, “All that I have written seems like straw to me.” This has led many to speculate about whether he had a direct encounter with the divine that made his own intellectual work feel insignificant by comparison. Nevertheless, the straw has fed many hungry minds since.

Aquinas’s legacy in bridging faith and reason was immense. Initially, some of his ideas faced opposition (certain Aristotelian propositions were temporarily condemned by ecclesiastical authorities shortly after his death). But within decades, his approach was vindicated and eventually the Church dubbed him the “Common Doctor.” By the 16th century, the Council of Trent leaned on his *Summa* for organizing its decrees. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, neo-Thomism became the backbone of Catholic intellectual formation. Even outside Catholicism, thinkers like Gottfried Leibniz admired Aquinas, and elements of Thomistic thought have been taken up by contemporary analytic philosophers of religion.

Yet, our task was not to chart his influence but to *experience* the core themes of his thought as he presented them. We’ve traveled through being and essence, up to God, down through creation and evil, into the human soul, and along the path of virtue and law. At each stage, Aquinas’s own words guided us, with scholarly context to light the scene. We have seen Aquinas argue that *existence* is the most fundamental act that makes everything real, and in God alone existence is identical with essence ([
           St. Thomas Aquinas: Summa Theologica -
        Christian Classics Ethereal Library
](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q3_A4.html#:~:text=Therefore%20that%20thing%2C%20whose%20existence,Therefore%20His)) ([Thomas Aquinas: Compendium theologiae: English](https://isidore.co/aquinas/Compendium.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L757%20it%20is,nothing%20else%20than%20His%20existence)). We have seen him insist that God, as Pure Act and absolute simple Being, is *utterly* unlike creatures in His mode of being, yet creatures analogically reflect His perfections ([Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Ente et Essentia](https://faculty.fordham.edu/klima/aquinas/dee7.pdf#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20although%20God%20is%20existence,this%20reason%20he%20is%20called)) ([Analogia entis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogia_entis#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20called%20a,maior%20dissimulitudo%20in%20tanta%20similitudine)). We have followed his explanation that evil is not a positive thing created by God but a privation – like cosmic “nothingness” that creeps in when creatures turn from the Good ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=understand%20the%20subject%20that%20is,particular%20good%2C%20not%20an%20entity)) ([](https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Logic/Logic%20Course%20Material/Aquinas%20Texts/Aquinas%20(Newer%20PDFs)/Quaestiones%20Disputatae%20de%20Malo%20ENGLISH.pdf#:~:text=And%20to%20prove%20this%2C%20we,is%20evident%20for%20three%20reasons)). We have learned from him that the human soul is the substantial form of the body, making a person one being, and that our rational nature is oriented to truth and goodness by design ([SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The union of body and soul (Prima Pars, Q. 76)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1076.htm#:~:text=that%20,the%20body%20precedes%20the%20soul)) ([Aquinas](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q91.A2.C#:~:text=it%20is%20evident%20that%20all,sacrifice%20of%20justice%2C%20as%20though)). We have heard him praise wisdom and truth as the highest pursuits, leading us ultimately to the contemplation of God ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=Now%20the%20last%20end%20of,and%20every%20truth%2C%20but%20of)) ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=OF%20all%20human%20pursuits%2C%20the,conversation%20hath%20no%20bitterness%2C%20nor)). We’ve also glimpsed a softer side – Aquinas the reconciler of cultural differences (translating Greek theological terms for Latin readers) ([Contra Errores Graecorum - St. Thomas Aquinas](https://web.archive.org/web/20080509054823/http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/errorgre.htm#:~:text=Second%2C%20because%20many%20terms%20which,say%20three%20persons%2C%20as%20Augustine)), Aquinas the advocate of playfulness in due measure, and Aquinas the extoller of friendship, both human and divine ([Aquinas: Quaestiones disputatae: De caritate](https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/QDdeVirtutibus2.htm#:~:text=,able%20are%20we%20to%20love)).

In a **Gen Z vernacular attempt**: Thomas Aquinas basically said, “Reality has a *logic*, y’all, and that logic points to God. Stay humble, check your facts (and your Aristotelian categories), love madly (with *caritas* of course), and don’t let the existence-essence distinction keep you up at night – it’s there so you can sleep soundly knowing God’s got the ontological foundation covered.” Behind that playful summary is a serious point: Aquinas constructed a worldview in which everything has its place, meaning, and final end in God. It’s an impressive *cosmic vibe check* where the vibe is rationality infused with faith.

To conclude on a note of clever humor Aquinas himself might have enjoyed: If the universe is a story, Aquinas would say it’s written by God in the language of being. Every creature is a word, every action a sentence, and the whole of creation a grand narrative leading back to the divine Author. Our job, through philosophy and theology, is to learn to *read* that story correctly – to “spell out” *ens* and *essentia* and all the rest without mispronouncing the plot. Aquinas, with his Summa quill pen, acted as a kind of scribe or translator of that story for us, footnoting along the way (“See Aristotle, *Metaphysics* V” or “Cf. Augustine, *Confessions*”). The ending of the story? Spoiler alert: God wins – or rather, His goodness permeates all and draws those who seek truth into an eternal friendship. As Aquinas puts it with scriptural backup: *“The desire of wisdom shall lead to an everlasting kingdom”* ([Summa Contra Gentiles I, 1-9](https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/courses/264/scgbk1chap1-9.htm#:~:text=dwell%20in%20wisdom%20,viii%2C%2016)). For those of us tagging along 800 years later, that’s a kingdom worth tweeting about – or better yet, worth entering into with mind and heart, guided by the profound and still-relevant insights of the Angelic Doctor.
