Ah—got it. You're asking not just for a single pre-17th-century figure, but for **all the great minds before 1600** across **math, logic, philosophy, and early computer science (proto-informatic thinking)** who:

1. Had a profound, foundational influence **on the later figures you listed**,  
2. Left behind **surviving, written works** that can still be read and studied today,  
3. Played roles in shaping the **intellectual heritage** that culminated in the scientific revolution, modern logic, and computation.

Let’s build that list, arranged chronologically and grouped by discipline (though many spanned several fields). These are the **landmark thinkers and texts** before your timeline begins in 1620:

---

## 🏺 **Ancient World (Pre–500 CE)**

### **7. Ptolemy** *(c. 100–170 CE)*  
- 📘 *Almagest*  
- Systematized the **geocentric model**, mathematical astronomy. This was **the dominant cosmology for 1,400+ years**.

## 📜 **Late Antiquity & Early Middle Ages (c. 200–1000 CE)**

### **8. Boethius** *(c. 480–524)*  
- 📘 *De Institutione Arithmetica*, *De Consolatione Philosophiae*  
- Transmitted **logic and mathematics** from Greek to Latin tradition. Crucial for medieval education.

### **9. Proclus** *(c. 412–485)*  
- 📘 *Commentary on Euclid*, *Elements of Theology*  
- Preserved Platonic and mathematical texts, connected philosophy and math through Neoplatonism.

## 🕌 **Islamic Golden Age (c. 800–1200)**

### **10. Al-Khwarizmi** *(c. 780–850)*  
- 📘 *Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala*  
- Invented **algebra** in a systematic way. His name gave us the word **algorithm**.

### **11. Al-Kindi** *(c. 801–873)*  
- 📘 *On the Use of the Indian Numerals*, works on logic, cryptography  
- Helped transmit Indian numerals and logic into the Arabic and Latin worlds.

### **12. Al-Farabi** *(c. 872–950)*  
- 📘 *Book of Letters*, *On the Intellect*  
- Systematized logic as a tool of philosophy, developed theories of the intellect and reasoning.

### **13. Avicenna (Ibn Sina)** *(980–1037)*  
- 📘 *The Book of Healing*, *The Canon of Medicine*  
- Synthesized **Aristotle’s logic** with Islamic philosophy. Dominated medieval thought in both East and West.

### **14. Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham)** *(c. 965–1040)*  
- 📘 *Book of Optics*  
- Proposed an **early version of the scientific method**: observation, experimentation, hypothesis.

### **15. Averroes (Ibn Rushd)** *(1126–1198)*  
- 📘 *Commentaries on Aristotle*  
- Reintroduced Aristotle to Europe, became central in debates on **reason vs. faith**.

## ✝️ **Medieval Latin World (c. 1100–1500)**

### **16. Anselm of Canterbury** *(1033–1109)*  
- 📘 *Proslogion*  
- Developed the **ontological argument** for God’s existence – an early exercise in modal reasoning.

### **17. Peter Abelard** *(1079–1142)*  
- 📘 *Sic et Non*  
- Launched critical dialectical reasoning within theology; proto-logical positivism in analyzing contradictions.

### **18. Thomas Aquinas** *(1225–1274)*  
- 📘 *Summa Theologiae*  
- Integrated **Aristotelian logic** with Christian theology. Shaped scholastic method and natural law theory.

### **19. Roger Bacon** *(1219–1292)*  
- 📘 *Opus Majus*  
- Early advocate for **empirical science**, mathematics, and language study. Precursor to Francis Bacon.

### **20. Ramon Llull** *(1232–1315)*  
- 📘 *Ars Magna*  
- Attempted to build a **logical machine** of concepts – arguably a **precursor to combinatorial computation**.

## 🖋 **Renaissance Thinkers (1300s–1500s)**

### **21. Nicole Oresme** *(c. 1320–1382)*  
- 📘 Works on geometry and motion  
- Plotted changing qualities graphically – a precursor to **analytic geometry and functions**.

### **22. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola** *(1463–1494)*  
- 📘 *Oration on the Dignity of Man*  
- Combined philosophy, religion, and humanist logic in a bold vision of man as rational agent.

### **23. Leonardo da Vinci** *(1452–1519)*  
- 📓 Scientific notebooks  
- No formal treatises, but **engineering blueprints, anatomical sketches**, and physics experiments were centuries ahead.

### **24. Niccolò Machiavelli** *(1469–1527)*  
- 📘 *The Prince*
