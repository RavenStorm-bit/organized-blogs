# Worldviews and Narratives of Selected Think Tanks

## Brookings Institution
Brookings promotes a **centrist, evidence-based worldview** grounded in strengthening liberal democracy and effective governance. Its recent work reflects a belief in bolstering institutions and informed public debate as the path to address current challenges. Brookings emphasizes nonpartisan rigor and pragmatic solutions, often aiming to bridge political divides. *“Brookings research and analysis informs thoughtful policy debate, educates an engaged electorate, and contributes to an understanding of what makes a healthy democracy,”* highlighting its commitment to independent, fact-driven work in service of democratic institutions ([Brookings 2024 Annual Report](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brookings-Institution-2024-Annual-Report.pdf#:~:text=informs%20thoughtful%20policy%20debate%2C%20educates,turn%20to%20Brookings%20for%20answers)). From domestic polarization to global development, Brookings’ mindset is one of **upholding the post-WWII liberal order** – advocating cooperation, robust institutions, and inclusive economic growth – albeit with updates to tackle today’s issues.

- **Protecting Democracy and Fighting Disinformation:** Brookings scholars frequently address threats to democracy such as political polarization and misinformation, proposing ways to reinforce checks and balances. For example, the institution launched initiatives to improve cooperation between branches of government and counter fake news, arguing that rebuilding trust and **“put[ting] forward solutions to strengthen democracy and support its institutions”** is crucial in an era of division ([Brookings 2024 Annual Report](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brookings-Institution-2024-Annual-Report.pdf#:~:text=From%20political%20polarization%20to%20inter,democracy%20and%20support%20its%20institutions)). Brookings’ dominant narrative is that the resilience of democracy can be restored through informed policymaking and bipartisanship. 

- **Global Development and Climate Finance:** In its international work, Brookings frames economic development as intertwined with good governance and climate action. The *Foresight Africa 2024* report exemplifies this, urging African leaders to accelerate reforms and **highlighting the need for development finance to tackle climate change** ([Foresight Africa 2024 spotlights Africa’s need for climate development finance DevelopmentAid](https://www.developmentaid.org/news-stream/post/174553/foresight-africa-2024#:~:text=Prioritizing%20economic%20diversification%2C%20trade%20integration%2C,issues%20have%20already%20been%20addressed)). It emphasizes priorities like job creation, trade integration, and diversification alongside climate resilience. Despite global headwinds, Brookings conveys a cautiously optimistic narrative that with strategic investment – for instance, financing green infrastructure – African economies can become more resilient and even lead in growth ([Foresight Africa 2024 spotlights Africa’s need for climate development finance DevelopmentAid](https://www.developmentaid.org/news-stream/post/174553/foresight-africa-2024#:~:text=The%202024%20priorities%20set%20by,outlined%20during%20the%20report%E2%80%99s%20launch)) ([Foresight Africa 2024 spotlights Africa’s need for climate development finance DevelopmentAid](https://www.developmentaid.org/news-stream/post/174553/foresight-africa-2024#:~:text=,Underscoring%20these%20five%20main)). This reflects Brookings’ broader worldview that economic prosperity and democratic governance go hand in hand.

- **Balanced, Pragmatic Policy Recommendations:** Brookings publications often provide moderate recommendations that contrast with more ideologically driven agendas. For example, Brookings experts have critiqued extreme policy proposals (such as certain plans in the 2024 U.S. election cycle) and instead advocate incremental, evidence-backed reforms in areas like education, economic policy, and foreign affairs. The tone is one of **pragmatic problem-solving** – e.g. suggesting updates to social programs or alliances rather than radical overhauls – consistent with Brookings’ role as a trusted, nonpartisan advisor ([Brookings 2024 Annual Report](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brookings-Institution-2024-Annual-Report.pdf#:~:text=informs%20thoughtful%20policy%20debate%2C%20educates,turn%20to%20Brookings%20for%20answers)).

**Unique Perspective:** Brookings’ approach is distinguished by its centrist and **institutionalist mindset**. Unlike more ideologically partisan think tanks, Brookings prides itself on independence and scholarly rigor, positioning itself as an “honest broker” of ideas. Its promotion of the liberal international order and multilateral cooperation – for instance, defending alliances and a rules-based system – stands out at a time when nationalist or populist narratives are on the rise. This relatively moderate, globalist perspective aligns Brookings with traditional policy elites, but its strong defense of democratic norms and factual discourse sets it apart from institutions that might sacrifice rigor for political agendas. In short, Brookings champions the **establishment consensus** (democracy, open markets, U.S. engagement abroad) but with updated analysis to counter contemporary threats, embodying a worldview of constructive engagement and **“solutions to strengthen democracy”** ([Brookings 2024 Annual Report](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brookings-Institution-2024-Annual-Report.pdf#:~:text=From%20political%20polarization%20to%20inter,democracy%20and%20support%20its%20institutions)) in contrast to the polarization prevalent elsewhere.

## Bruegel (Brussels, EU)
Bruegel advances a **pro-European, reformist worldview** focused on strengthening the European Union’s economic resilience and global role. As a leading EU economics think tank, Bruegel’s recent work is framed by the belief that Europe must **“unite, defend, [and] grow”** in the face of crises ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=reflected%20in%20the%20title%20of,successful%20enlargement%20to%20new%20members)). This mindset emphasizes European integration, open markets, and evidence-based policy as the keys to prosperity – while also acknowledging new realities like geopolitical competition and climate urgency. Bruegel’s worldview is one of *guarded liberalism*: defending core liberal-economic values (multilateralism, competition, fiscal prudence) but adapting them to address security threats and social/climate imperatives. The tone of its 2024 flagship memos is notably sober about challenges (from war to populism), yet optimistic that bolder, “braver” EU action can meet them ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=Most%20important%2C%20the%20EU%20must,greater%20share%20of%20investment%20is)).

- **Multilateralism vs. Nationalism:** A central Bruegel narrative is a warning against economic nationalism in Europe. In memos to incoming EU leaders, Bruegel bluntly argues that the EU **“should not jump on the nationalist bandwagon… Openness and competition remain cornerstones of EU prosperity”** ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=What%20policy%20recommendations%20follow%3F%20The,EU%20can%20do%20that%20creates)). Recent Bruegel analyses champion *multilateral solutions* – for instance, proposing EU-wide approaches to trade and industrial policy rather than go-it-alone national strategies. They stress that a retreat into protectionism would undermine Europe’s clout and economic health. This aligns with Bruegel’s longstanding worldview favoring EU integration and global rules, distinguishing its stance from more protectionist or sovereignty-focused institutions.

- **Security and “Strategic Autonomy”:** In response to current events (like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and U.S.–China tensions), Bruegel’s work increasingly integrates security into economic policy. It recommends Europe become more assertive in defense and tech – to **“defend the EU from external threats”** while still upholding its values ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=reflected%20in%20the%20title%20of,successful%20enlargement%20to%20new%20members)). For example, Bruegel calls for higher defense investment and even a *European single market for defence production* (explicitly suggesting the UK be included) ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=credibility%20in%20the%20world,competitiveness%20and%20ensures%20that%20vulnerable)). It also advocates reducing critical dependencies (energy, supply chains) without abandoning openness. This nuanced stance – boosting European “strategic autonomy” in key sectors but not forsaking global cooperation – is an emerging narrative in Bruegel’s recent output. It reflects a unique balance: acknowledging that the EU must be more security-conscious and **“cannot be naïve”** about great-power rivalry ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=credibility%20in%20the%20world,But%20this%20can%20only)), yet cautioning against throwing out the benefits of interdependence.

- **Green and Inclusive Growth:** Bruegel places the climate transition at the heart of its economic narrative. It strongly backs the EU Green Deal and emissions cuts, but *with pragmatism*: **“the EU must persevere with its Green Deal… [while] preserv[ing] industrial competitiveness and ensuring vulnerable groups are protected.”** ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=Fourth%2C%20the%20EU%20must%20persevere,countries%20to%20accelerate%20emissions%20mitigation)) Recent Bruegel reports make the economic case for large-scale climate finance – for instance, urging advanced economies to fund coal-to-renewables transitions in developing countries ([Highlights of 2024](https://www.bruegel.org/anthology/highlights-2024#:~:text=Policy%20Brief)). They also highlight the need for innovation and investment in clean tech (Bruegel maintains a *European Clean Tech Tracker* to monitor progress ([Highlights of 2024](https://www.bruegel.org/anthology/highlights-2024#:~:text=23%20October%202024%20%20,Dataset))). Coupled with this is a focus on inclusive growth: Bruegel’s worldview stresses that social cohesion (preventing inequality or regional divides) is integral to sustaining support for open markets and climate policies ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20problems%20we,Economic)) ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=Fourth%2C%20the%20EU%20must%20persevere,countries%20to%20accelerate%20emissions%20mitigation)). This holistic approach – green *and* growth-oriented, global *and* local – differentiates Bruegel’s narrative from traditional economic institutions that might treat climate as a side issue. Bruegel instead frames sustainability as central to Europe’s future economic model.

**Unique Perspective:** As an EU-focused think tank, Bruegel’s perspective diverges from many traditional (often US-centered or nation-centric) policy institutes. It operates with an inherently **supranational outlook**, treating European integration as the default solution space. This leads to unique positions: for example, recommending EU-level fiscal rules and budgetary frameworks, or EU-led investments, which national-level think tanks might not emphasize. Bruegel’s explicit defense of *multilateralism and the liberal international order* ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=What%20policy%20recommendations%20follow%3F%20The,EU%20can%20do%20that%20creates)) also sets it apart in an era when some institutions have grown skeptical of globalization. Additionally, Bruegel’s combination of technocratic rigor with big-picture vision (“unite, defend, grow”) is distinctive – it simultaneously provides wonky analysis (e.g. models of debt sustainability or climate finance) and calls for high-level political courage (urging EU leaders to be “creative and bold…‘braver’” than before ([Unite, defend, grow: Memos to the European Union leadership 2024-2029](https://www.bruegel.org/book/unite-defend-grow-memos-european-union-leadership-2024-2029#:~:text=Most%20important%2C%20the%20EU%20must,greater%20share%20of%20investment%20is))). Compared to more traditional policy shops, Bruegel is **less constrained by ideology** (neither left nor right in a classic sense) but rather by a commitment to the European project itself. Its willingness to rethink orthodoxies – such as proposing joint EU defense procurement or new financial tools – gives it a pragmatic yet forward-looking voice among think tanks, aligning with but also pushing beyond EU officialdom’s usual narratives.

## Open Philanthropy
Open Philanthropy (often just “Open Phil”) espouses a **global, impact-maximization mindset** rooted in *Effective Altruism*. Unlike traditional think tanks, Open Phil is a grantmaking foundation that publishes research on how to do the most good. Its worldview prioritizes causes based on scale of impact, neglectedness, and tractability – an explicit framework it applies across disparate issues. *“To achieve our mission of helping others as much as possible… we seek out causes that are important… neglected… and tractable,”* Open Phil explains of its approach ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20diverse%20areas%20we%20work,seek%20out%20causes%20that%20are)). This leads it to fund and research a mix of **long-term global challenges and near-term humanitarian issues**. The dominant mindset is unabashedly outcome-oriented: moral urgency paired with scientific rigor in identifying where each dollar or policy change can save or improve the most lives.

- **Effective Altruism in Action – Cause Prioritization:** Open Phil’s key narrative is that resources should flow to the world’s most pressing but under-addressed problems. In practice, this has meant very diverse focus areas, all chosen through the same lens. For example, in 2024 Open Phil funded major global health interventions like expanded clean water access, deworming, malaria prevention, and malnutrition treatment – all areas where evidence shows high cost-effectiveness in saving lives ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Global%20Health%20and%20Development%20%3A%C2%A0Our,67%2C%20and%20deworming)) ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=mortality%20in%20children%20under%20five,67%2C%20and%20deworming)). It cites data (often from partner evaluator GiveWell) that chlorinating water can cut child mortality by **12%** and thus directs grants accordingly ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Global%20Health%20and%20Development%20%3A%C2%A0Our,67%2C%20and%20deworming)). At the same time, Open Phil invests in more **speculative, long-term issues** that few others fund, such as pandemic preparedness, biosecurity, and potential risks from advanced AI. This duality – both bednets *and* biolabs – is tied together by the worldview that doing the most good may involve both **proven health programs and preventing low-probability catastrophes**. Open Phil frequently publishes its reasoning, acknowledging uncertainty but making bets on neglected opportunities. This level of transparency and calculation (e.g. publishing cause selection criteria, grant writeups, even errors) reflects a unique culture of **“open” analysis and iterative learning** in philanthropy ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20diverse%20areas%20we%20work,seek%20out%20causes%20that%20are)) ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Sometimes%2C%20we%20are%20one%20funder,a%20mix%20of%20funding%20strategies)).

- **Key Insights & Initiatives:** Several emerging narratives stand out in Open Phil’s recent work:
  - *Global Health and Poverty:* Open Phil continues to stress that tremendous gains are possible in global health with relatively modest funds. In 2024 it highlighted successes like a major grant to provide clean drinking water and support for vaccination efforts, noting that these basic interventions remain highly neglected in certain areas ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Global%20Health%20and%20Development%20%3A%C2%A0Our,67%2C%20and%20deworming)) ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=merged,on%20treating%20communicable%20diseases%20continued)). Its recommendation to scale water chlorination or deworming programs comes from a worldview that values human lives equally across borders, focusing on where an extra dollar can have outsized benefit. 
  - *Science and Technology for Global Good:* A significant narrative is funding scientific research that markets or governments overlook. Open Phil merged its Science and Global Health R&D programs, underlining the overlap in developing cures for diseases that predominantly affect the poor ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Science%20%20and%20%209%3A,on%20treating%20communicable%20diseases%20continued)). It has funded work on sickle cell disease and snakebite antivenoms, citing new studies that these may cause far more death and disability than previously thought ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Science%20%20and%20%209%3A,on%20treating%20communicable%20diseases%20continued)). Open Phil’s mindset here is that *innovation should target humanitarian gaps*, not just rich-world problems. They even intervened to keep open a critical biomedical database and to back an ambitious partnership on a new tuberculosis vaccine ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Access%20Initiative%20is%20coordinating%20market,of%20a%20new%20tuberculosis%20vaccine)). These actions illustrate a narrative that enabling scientific progress (from data infrastructure to vaccines) is a high-leverage way to help millions in the long run.
  - *Animal Welfare and Beyond-Human Interests:* Distinctively, Open Phil treats factory farming and animal suffering as major moral issues. It dedicates funds to farm animal welfare campaigns – for instance, helping secure hundreds of corporate commitments to cage-free eggs and better chicken treatment worldwide ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Farm%20Animal%20Welfare%20%3A%20Corporate,82%20the%20alternative%20protein%20space)). It also explores wild animal welfare and supports the development of alternatives to animal protein ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=our%20work%20in%20this%20space,promote%20the%20alternative%20protein%20space)). This reflects a broadening worldview that *“helping others”* includes non-human animals, a stance rare among policy institutions. The narrative is that reducing animal cruelty at scale (through corporate policy change or innovation in food tech) is an important, neglected cause aligned with global compassion.
  - *Reducing Existential and Catastrophic Risks:* Open Phil is one of the few major funders sounding the alarm on low-probability but high-stakes risks. In 2024 it ramped up work on **pandemic prevention** (funding think tanks and NGOs to push better biosecurity policies) and on risks from advanced AI ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=Biosecurity%20%26%20Pandemic%20Preparedness%20%3A,unprecedented%20biological%20threat%20if%20created)). It launched requests for proposals to **build capacity against global catastrophic risks**, including grants for research on AI safety and forecasting methods to anticipate risks ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20team%20also%20launched%20two,appeal%20to%20you%2C%20consider%20applying)) ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=This%20year%2C%20Open%20Philanthropy%20also,in%20%20135%20grants%20to)). A narrative here is that society systematically under-invests in preventing disasters that haven’t happened yet – so Open Phil steps in to fill that gap. It even created a new **Forecasting** program to improve how we predict and thus mitigate big risks, using techniques like prediction markets and probabilistic forecasting to guide its decisions ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=)). By funding work on things like better AI monitoring or “mirror virus” research (exotic bio-risks), Open Phil signals a worldview of *responsible longtermism*: taking the welfare of future generations as seriously as present-day needs.
  - *Meta-Initiatives and Field Building:* Open Phil also isn’t shy about examining how philanthropy itself can improve. It set up a $150 million **Regranting Challenge** to empower other grantmakers and experimented with funding economic growth research for low-income countries (an area many development donors had abandoned as intractable) ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=We%20also%20launched%20a%20search,direct%20at%20least%20%2430%20million)) ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=I%20also%20wanted%20to%20share,Gu%C3%A9rin%20vaccine%20only%20provides)). By announcing a new **“LMIC Growth” program**, it revealed optimism that even extremely hard problems like boosting poor-country GDP can yield to creative philanthropy with the right evidence ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=We%20also%20launched%20a%20search,direct%20at%20least%20%2430%20million)). This meta-approach – funding other funders, trying bold new cause areas – showcases Open Phil’s narrative that *philanthropy should be maximally experimental and self-reflective*. It openly discusses setbacks too, such as how turmoil at the U.S. Agency for International Development stalled a major development project it was backing ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=On%20the%20negative%20side%2C%20the,can%20continue%20in%20some%20form)), demonstrating transparency about challenges and a systems-level view of change (in this case, stepping in when public institutions falter).

**Unique Perspective:** Open Philanthropy’s worldview and methods represent a **departure from traditional policy institutions** in several ways. First, its **effective altruist orientation** means it is fundamentally cause-agnostic and globally focused – it does not limit itself to a region or policy domain, but rather to *outcomes* (whether it’s preventing extinctions or improving farm policy, the guiding question is “how much good will this do?”). This contrasts with most think tanks that have a set topical or ideological niche. Second, Open Phil is unusually willing to embrace **unorthodox or “high-risk, high-reward” causes** (like AI existential risk or wild animal welfare) that standard policy experts might overlook or dismiss. Its analytic, quantitative style – publishing cost-effectiveness estimates, probability-weighted risks, etc. – gives it a quasi-academic flavor, yet it couples this with an activist urgency to actually fund interventions, not just study them. Finally, Open Phil’s practice of publicly sharing its reasoning and updates (including mistakes) is a form of radical transparency and humility not typically seen in older institutions. It operates at the intersection of a think tank and a foundation, leveraging research to directly **move resources where they’ll do the most good** ([Our Progress in 2024 and Plans for 2025 | Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/#:~:text=The%20diverse%20areas%20we%20work,seek%20out%20causes%20that%20are)). This results in a unique narrative about **doing philanthropy based on evidence and ethics** – effectively trying to reshape how the broader philanthropic and policy world sets priorities, pushing it toward a more global and future-conscious mindset.

## Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)
RMI (formerly Rocky Mountain Institute) embodies an **optimistic, solutions-driven worldview on climate and energy**. Often dubbed a “think-and-do tank,” RMI’s mission is *“to transform global energy use to create a clean, prosperous, and secure low-carbon future.”* ([Rocky Mountain Institute - MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/grantee/rocky-mountain-institute-2513/#:~:text=Rocky%20Mountain%20Institute%20,It%20enables%20RMI%20to)) This encapsulates a mindset that economic prosperity and climate security are mutually achievable through bold action and innovation. RMI’s recent work brims with confidence in **market-based, technological solutions to decarbonization**: it promotes energy efficiency, renewable energy, and new business models as win-win opportunities. The worldview is neither naive about climate change – RMI acknowledges the climate crisis with urgency – nor fatalistic; instead, it highlights breakthroughs and actionable pathways, aiming to **“cut greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030”** in line with global climate goals ([RMI Relaunches to Transform Energy on a Global Scale, Building ...](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/04/rmi-relaunches-to-transform-energy-on-a-global-scale-building-on-nearly-40-years-of-analysis-insight-and-market-innovation/#:~:text=RMI%20Relaunches%20to%20Transform%20Energy,clean%2C%20prosperous%20and%20secure%20future)). A hallmark of RMI’s narrative is focusing on *implementation*: turning ideas into pilots and scaling up successes on the ground.

- **Clean Energy Transition as Opportunity:** RMI consistently frames the clean energy transition as an economic opportunity, not a burden. Its analyses point out dramatic drops in clean technology costs and the benefits of transitioning quickly. In a 2024 year-end summary, RMI noted that **battery prices continue to plummet (around 60% cheaper than five years ago) ([The Top Ten Climate Developments of 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/the-top-ten-climate-developments-of-2024/#:~:text=,Best%20Friend))**, enabling electric vehicles and grid storage to take off. It celebrated the fact that around the world, batteries and solar are already providing reliable power – for example, through solar-plus-storage microgrids that kept communities’ lights on during hurricanes ([The Top Ten Climate Developments of 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/the-top-ten-climate-developments-of-2024/#:~:text=Battery%20prices%20continue%20to%20drop,communities%20this%20past%20hurricane%20season)). Another “top climate development” RMI highlighted was that Americans are getting *cheaper and cleaner energy* as renewables outcompete fossil fuels in many regions ([The Top Ten Climate Developments of 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/the-top-ten-climate-developments-of-2024/#:~:text=,Best%20Friend)) ([The Top Ten Climate Developments of 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/the-top-ten-climate-developments-of-2024/#:~:text=,Energy)). The underlying narrative: **clean tech is now economically competitive** and is being embraced by forward-looking businesses, consumers, and regulators. This optimistic messaging starkly contrasts with outdated views that climate action is primarily a cost or sacrifice; RMI instead documents how it’s becoming a driver of growth and resilience.

- **Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Climate Solutions:** RMI’s worldview places heavy emphasis on innovation – not just in technology, but in policy and finance. It champions concepts like **“virtual power plants” (VPPs)**: networks of distributed resources (solar panels, home batteries, EVs, smart thermostats) that collectively provide power grid services. RMI argues VPPs can obviate the need for new fossil power plants while **saving more than \$15 billion annually by 2030** in the U.S. ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=lowering%20customer%20bills%2C%20and%20decreasing,15%20billion%20annually%20by%202030)). In 2024, RMI convened utilities and tech firms in a *Virtual Power Plant Partnership* to push supportive policies and showcased case studies in a *VPP “flipbook”* guide ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=With%2019%20members%20from%20the,efficient%20and%20impactful%20VPP%20programs)). Similarly, RMI is tackling how to decarbonize heavy transport and buildings through innovation. It worked with Indian partners on **electric two- and three-wheeler adoption**, publishing a guide on de-risking loans for electric rickshaws and motorcycles – which has already helped Indian financiers scale up EV lending ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=India%20has%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20largest,burning%20vehicles%20on%20their%20roads)) ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=reduce%20air%20pollution%2C%20save%20money%2C,and%20improve%20health)). By focusing on such practical financial and policy tweaks, RMI’s narrative is that *the barriers to clean tech adoption can be overcome with creative market-based solutions*. We see an entrepreneurial ethos: identify the market failures or knowledge gaps holding back progress, then pilot a fix and share the results.

- **Community-Level Climate Resilience:** Alongside big-picture global transition strategies, RMI’s recent work also highlights local, community-based initiatives, underlining a worldview that the energy transition must be inclusive. For instance, RMI organized cohorts of U.S. local governments, tribal communities, and schools to help them tap new federal funds for **solar microgrids** ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=This%20past%20year%20RMI%20organized,storage%20microgrids)). These microgrids not only cut emissions but serve as *resilience hubs* – keeping power on during outages and disasters to provide shelter and critical services ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=These%20microgrids%20will%20serve%20as,communities%20achieve%20their%20emissions%20goals)). RMI’s reporting features success stories like a market in Abuja, Nigeria powered by a solar mini-grid that allows a tailor to run sewing machines reliably (no longer needing a diesel generator) ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Mary%20Alaele%20Baelanki)) ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=Mary%20Alaele%20Baelanki%20is%20a,Baelanki%E2%80%99s%20sewing%20machines%20and%20iron)). By sharing personal stories from Nigeria to Puerto Rico, RMI paints a narrative that clean energy can empower communities and improve lives immediately. It’s a **people-centered climate narrative**, countering the notion that decarbonization is only about abstract emissions numbers. Ensuring energy access and reliability – for **“everyone [to have] access to the clean, affordable electricity they need”** ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=In%20the%2021st%20century%2C%20with,clean%2C%20affordable%20electricity%20they%20need)) – is presented as integral to the transition. This focus on equity and resilience distinguishes RMI from purely technical perspectives; it sees climate solutions as a means to human development (e.g., job creation, public health benefits from less pollution, energy justice).

- **Climate Challenge and Urgency:** RMI doesn’t shy from highlighting the dire state of the climate, but it immediately pivots to solutions. In its 2024 annual report, RMI noted that *“last year was the warmest ever recorded…dangerous heat waves…5 billion more air conditioners by 2050”* will be needed if trends continue ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=Last%20year%20was%20the%20warmest,carbon%20than%20typical%20AC%20units)). Rather than despair, RMI spotlighted its role in the **Global Cooling Prize**, an innovation competition it co-launched that yielded super-efficient AC designs with 5x lower emissions than typical units ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=extreme%20heat%20is%20expected%20to,carbon%20than%20typical%20AC%20units)) ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=RMI%2C%20the%20Government%20of%20India%2C,carbon%20than%20typical%20AC%20units)). Now, RMI is helping pilot and push these designs into the market by assembling a coalition to navigate regulatory and commercial hurdles ([Annual Report 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/annual-report-2024/#:~:text=With%20the%20technology%20piloted%2C%20the,efficient%20units%20to%20market)). This exemplifies RMI’s can-do narrative: every big climate problem (like the AC-driven “cooling crunch”) is an opportunity for a clever solution (better technology + coordinated deployment). The urgency of climate change is front and center, but always paired with a sense of *agency* – a belief that through innovation and collaboration, we can “bend the curve.” RMI’s language is often that of a **“tipping point”** in progress: for instance, noting historic policy moves (like U.S. states and cooperatives investing billions from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act) as evidence that clean energy momentum is now unstoppable ([The Top Ten Climate Developments of 2024 - RMI](https://rmi.org/the-top-ten-climate-developments-of-2024/#:~:text=,Energy)).

**Unique Perspective:** RMI’s approach is unique in the think tank world for its **action-oriented, techno-optimist ethos**. It truly operates as a *“think **and** do”* tank ([Rocky Mountain Institute - MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/grantee/rocky-mountain-institute-2513/#:~:text=Rocky%20Mountain%20Institute%20,It%20enables%20RMI%20to)) – many staff work directly on implementing projects or advising businesses/governments on execution, which traditional policy institutes might leave to consultants or NGOs. This gives RMI a practitioner’s credibility and a certain pragmatism; their publications often read as field reports or solution blueprints rather than academic theory. In contrast to more staid institutions, RMI unabashedly partners with industry and local authorities to test ideas (from running real grid pilots to co-developing finance models), reflecting a belief that market forces can be harnessed for public good. Its worldview also diverges from some traditional environmental groups by being **pro-growth and pro-technology** – it talks about opportunity, jobs, and competitiveness as much as climate targets, thereby influencing business and bipartisan audiences. Yet RMI is not merely pro-business; it is **system-change oriented** in its own way, aiming to reinvent how energy is produced and used globally. This positions RMI somewhat outside the classic left-right spectrum: for example, it will work with oil companies on transitioning to clean energy, something a more ideologically driven climate organization might eschew. Finally, RMI’s habit of spotlighting success stories and progress (e.g. “10 climate developments of 2024”) sets it apart from traditional policy think tanks that often dwell on problems and recommendations. RMI instead markets a narrative of **hope through tangible action** – making it a source of practical inspiration in policy circles and a unique bridge between high-level climate goals and on-the-ground implementation.

## World Resources Institute (WRI)
WRI advances a **holistic, systems-change worldview** centered on the nexus of environment, economy, and human well-being. As a global research NGO, WRI sees the world’s challenges – climate change, biodiversity loss, inequality, urbanization – as interlinked and rooted in our current models of production and governance. Its recent work calls for **transformative changes** in these systems rather than piecemeal fixes. WRI’s mindset is encapsulated in its mission to develop “pathways toward equitable, low-carbon, and resilient economies” tailored to local contexts ([World Resources Institute Careers - Chief Economist](https://jobs.jobvite.com/wri/job/oMyBvfwa#:~:text=We%20zero%20in%20on%20the,partners%20in%20over%2050%20nations)). This means simultaneously pursuing climate stability, nature protection, and improved lives for people (especially the poor and marginalized). The institute’s worldview is optimistic that a better future is possible, but candid that it requires overhauling entrenched practices. WRI often emphasizes collaboration – working with governments, businesses, and civil society – under a principle that sustainable solutions must be inclusive and backed by broad coalitions.

- **Integrated “People-Nature-Climate” Agenda:** A defining narrative in WRI’s work is the inseparability of human development and environmental sustainability. WRI argues that economic growth and poverty reduction can (and must) be achieved in conjunction with cutting emissions and conserving ecosystems. Its President & CEO Ani Dasgupta has highlighted “stories to watch” that illustrate this integration – for instance, how upcoming **elections and policy decisions could drive action on climate-smart food systems and cleaner cities** ([4 Climate Stories that Will Define 2024 | World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/insights/4-climate-stories-will-define-2024#:~:text=4%20Climate%20Stories%20that%20Will,climate%2C%20food%2C%20energy%20and%20cities)). WRI often stresses that decisions in silos won’t suffice; instead, aligning policies for climate and nature yields co-benefits. One recent insight is WRI’s push for the world to **“tackle climate and nature together in 2025,”** urging that new global biodiversity targets (from the COP16 biodiversity summit) be linked with climate targets ([Why the Next 3 Months Are Critical for People, Nature and Climate - We Can Fix Climate Change](https://wecanfixclimatechange.com/2024/09/why-the-next-3-months-are-critical-for-people-nature-and-climate/#:~:text=Decision,to%20achieve%20transformative%20global%20goals)). This narrative was evident in late 2024 when a series of major international summits (UN General Assembly, Climate COP28/COP29, Biodiversity COP16, G20, etc.) occurred. WRI framed those three months as **“a unique chance to address the biggest challenges facing people, nature and climate”**, but warned that past incremental progress was insufficient ([Why the Next 3 Months Are Critical for People, Nature and Climate - We Can Fix Climate Change](https://wecanfixclimatechange.com/2024/09/why-the-next-3-months-are-critical-for-people-nature-and-climate/#:~:text=Decision,to%20achieve%20transformative%20global%20goals)). The message: only by concurrently addressing climate change, ecosystem loss, and inequality can global goals be met. This systems perspective differentiates WRI’s commentary from more single-issue organizations.

- **Urgency for Scaled-Up Climate Finance and Policy Ambition:** WRI’s recent publications put significant weight on the need for greater resources and stronger policies to achieve global climate goals, especially for developing countries. It points out stark gaps: for example, WRI noted that *developing countries collectively need $2.4 trillion per year by 2030* to meet their climate and development objectives ([Why the Next 3 Months Are Critical for People, Nature and Climate - We Can Fix Climate Change](https://wecanfixclimatechange.com/2024/09/why-the-next-3-months-are-critical-for-people-nature-and-climate/#:~:text=2,is%20essential%20for%20sustainable%20investment)). This figure, cited in context of setting a new international climate finance goal, underscores WRI’s narrative that the scale of investment must dramatically increase. WRI experts argue for a new, more ambitious climate finance commitment to replace the outdated $100 billion/year pledge, and insist that wealthy nations fulfill existing promises (such as funding for conservation and adaptation) ([Why the Next 3 Months Are Critical for People, Nature and Climate - We Can Fix Climate Change](https://wecanfixclimatechange.com/2024/09/why-the-next-3-months-are-critical-for-people-nature-and-climate/#:~:text=4,is%20essential%20for%20sustainable%20investment)). Additionally, WRI calls for **reforming the global financial system** – including multilateral development banks – to unlock sustainable investments and debt relief, so that poorer countries can afford climate action without sacrificing development ([Why the Next 3 Months Are Critical for People, Nature and Climate - We Can Fix Climate Change](https://wecanfixclimatechange.com/2024/09/why-the-next-3-months-are-critical-for-people-nature-and-climate/#:~:text=4,is%20essential%20for%20sustainable%20investment)). This narrative came through in WRI’s analysis around the World Bank/IMF meetings and the COP28 climate conference, where WRI pushed ideas like greener lending criteria and debt-for-climate swaps. Compared to traditional economic policy think tanks, WRI is uniquely focused on greening finance at a systemic level (not just project-by-project), effectively bridging climate advocacy with finance ministry language. 

- **Transforming Key Economic Sectors:** WRI’s worldview in practice means targeting the big leverage points in energy, cities, food, and land use. Recent WRI research tracks progress (or lack thereof) in these sectors – for instance, its *State of Climate Action 2023* report identified where clean energy deployment or sustainable food production must accelerate to hit 2030 milestones ([Methodology Underpinning the State of Climate Action Series: 2024 ...](https://www.wri.org/research/methodology-underpinning-state-climate-action-series-2024-update#:~:text=,transform%2C%20translating%20these%20transformations)). WRI provides data-driven charts to show the gap between current trends and required action (e.g., how much faster renewable power capacity must grow, or how far deforestation needs to decline). The narrative is somewhat two-sided: on one hand, WRI celebrates gains like record renewable installations or more electric vehicles on the road; on the other, it bluntly points out that many sectors are *“off-track”* for the Paris Agreement goals ([Global Climate Pledges: A Progress Report](https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-commitment-tracker#:~:text=Global%20Climate%20Pledges%3A%20A%20Progress,reform%20food%20systems%20and)). By quantifying these transformations, WRI gives concrete shape to its worldview – essentially a roadmap for overhauling energy, transport, and land systems. It also stresses solutions: for cities, WRI has highlighted examples of mayors adopting policies for cleaner air and mobility; for food, it convenes dialogues on how to shift to sustainable diets and reduce waste. The key insight is always that incremental improvements must become exponential changes. WRI’s commentary around the 2024 UN Climate Summit, for example, pressed leaders to not just update their pledges (NDCs) but to implement structural policies at home – such as fossil fuel subsidy reforms or nature-based solutions – citing that only bold steps would be “transformative” enough ([Why the Next 3 Months Are Critical for People, Nature and Climate - We Can Fix Climate Change](https://wecanfixclimatechange.com/2024/09/why-the-next-3-months-are-critical-for-people-nature-and-climate/#:~:text=Decision,to%20achieve%20transformative%20global%20goals)).

- **Equity and Just Transition:** Another thread in WRI’s narrative is ensuring that the transition to a sustainable economy is fair and inclusive. WRI often notes the disparate impacts of climate change and environmental degradation on poorer communities and nations. In its discussions on climate finance, for instance, WRI emphasizes not just aggregate dollars but also *justice*: calling out that those least responsible for emissions (developing nations) are facing the worst impacts and thus deserve financial support. The institute also works on access to energy and clean water for all, and on issues like city slum upgrading and equitable transit. This focus on equity is a core part of WRI’s worldview – a sustainable future must also close gaps in opportunity and well-being. So in “stories to watch,” WRI might highlight an election in a major democracy that could bring climate justice advocates to power, or a new data tool that identifies which communities lack tree cover and are heat-stressed (so resources can be targeted there). By embedding social equity into environmental solutions, WRI sets itself apart from older conservation organizations that historically focused more narrowly on wilderness or emissions in isolation. WRI instead talks about a **“people-centered approach”** to climate and sustainability, aligning climate action with jobs, public health, and local priorities.

**Unique Perspective:** WRI’s perspective is unique in that it operates at the **intersection of environment, development, and governance**, whereas traditional think tanks might silo these areas. WRI is often described as not just a think tank but a **networked global institute** – with over 1,000 experts and practitioners in offices across the world – which allows it to combine high-level analysis with on-the-ground implementation. This model gives WRI a practical bent similar to RMI’s (they pilot projects, like restoring landscapes in Africa or expanding electric buses in cities, to learn what works), but WRI also directly informs international policy processes (providing research to UN summits, etc.). Its pluralistic, multi-stakeholder approach (working “with a diverse range of stakeholders…tailored to local contexts” ([World Resources Institute Careers - Chief Economist](https://jobs.jobvite.com/wri/job/oMyBvfwa#:~:text=We%20zero%20in%20on%20the,partners%20in%20over%2050%20nations))) contrasts with more state-centric institutions. Moreover, WRI’s **systems-change rhetoric** – openly saying we must *“overhaul the unsustainable production and consumption patterns”* driving current crises ([World Resources Institute Careers - Chief Economist](https://jobs.jobvite.com/wri/job/oMyBvfwa#:~:text=At%20WRI%2C%20we%20know%20that,shape%20people%E2%80%99s%20decisions%20and%20behaviors)) – is relatively bold. Traditional policy outfits might focus on incremental policy tweaks, whereas WRI calls for rethinking entire sectors and aligns itself with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals as guiding frameworks. However, WRI distinguishes itself from purely activist groups by backing its stance with rigorous data and by engaging policymakers in a non-confrontational way (e.g., developing tools that governments use to measure emissions or map forests). In summary, WRI’s worldview melds advocacy for big transformation with the credibility of data-driven research, carving out a role as a **leading voice for integrated sustainability** in the policy arena. Its insistence that economic development and environmental stewardship must proceed together – and that this is achievable – offers a hopeful yet demanding narrative that both complements and challenges more traditional institutions.

## RadicalxChange Foundation
RadicalxChange (RxC) promotes a **pluralistic and radical reimagining of socio-economic systems**. Its worldview starts from the critique that many structures of today – especially those driven purely by market capitalism or one-person-one-vote democracy – **fail to capture the complex preferences and equal dignity of all individuals** ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=The%20best%20opportunities%20for%20liberating,challenges%20rather%20than%20solving%20them)). In RxC’s view, emerging technologies present an opportunity to redesign institutions for greater equity and community empowerment, but only if we deliberately encode new values into them. They explicitly look *“beyond capitalism and other conventional wisdom”* to unlock social progress ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=So%20we%20need%20to%20look,accepting%20the%20legitimacy%20of%20compromises)). The mindset is experimental and idealistic: combining **mechanism design** (game theory, economics, tech tools) with **social justice goals**. RadicalxChange’s recent work and narratives revolve around concepts like **quadratic voting, data as labor, common ownership, and decentralization**, which aim to redistribute power and voice in novel ways. Their worldview can be described as *pro-democracy, but not in the traditional sense* – they seek deeper democracy in everyday economic and civic life through inventive mechanisms.

- **Quadratic Voting and Plural Governance:** One of RxC’s flagship ideas is **Quadratic Voting (QV)** – a voting system that allows people to express intensity of preference, not just a single yes/no, by buying additional votes on issues (with the cost escalating quadratically). In recent work, RadicalxChange has demonstrated QV in real-world settings. A notable example was a 2023 participatory budgeting pilot in New York City’s Harlem, where residents used a QV platform (branded “Harlem Wallet” for *Plural Voting*) to allocate city funds among community projects ([The Future of Quadratic Voting: Collaborating with RadicalxChange | by Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) | Medium](https://medium.com/@kristininharlem/the-future-of-quadratic-voting-collaborating-with-radicalxchange-4ef85528d0e9#:~:text=Councilwoman%20Kristin%20Jordan%20of%20District,its%20practicality%20for%20broader%20adoption)). Each participant could spread voice credits across proposals they cared about, rather than being limited to one vote per project. This pilot, done in partnership with an NYC Council member, was hailed as a **“significant advancement in civic processes”**, showing that ordinary citizens *can* engage with these new democratic tools at scale ([The Future of Quadratic Voting: Collaborating with RadicalxChange | by Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) | Medium](https://medium.com/@kristininharlem/the-future-of-quadratic-voting-collaborating-with-radicalxchange-4ef85528d0e9#:~:text=Councilwoman%20Kristin%20Jordan%20of%20District,its%20practicality%20for%20broader%20adoption)) ([The Future of Quadratic Voting: Collaborating with RadicalxChange | by Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) | Medium](https://medium.com/@kristininharlem/the-future-of-quadratic-voting-collaborating-with-radicalxchange-4ef85528d0e9#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20was%20an%20honor%20to,%E2%80%9D)). Feedback was positive – people appreciated being able to vote from home and to signal which projects mattered most to them ([The Future of Quadratic Voting: Collaborating with RadicalxChange | by Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) | Medium](https://medium.com/@kristininharlem/the-future-of-quadratic-voting-collaborating-with-radicalxchange-4ef85528d0e9#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20was%20an%20honor%20to,%E2%80%9D)) ([The Future of Quadratic Voting: Collaborating with RadicalxChange | by Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) | Medium](https://medium.com/@kristininharlem/the-future-of-quadratic-voting-collaborating-with-radicalxchange-4ef85528d0e9#:~:text=The%20pilot%20program%20used%20a,%E2%80%9D%20said%20one%20of%20the)). The narrative RxC puts forth from such pilots is that **democracy can be made more inclusive and representative** by moving beyond one-person-one-vote. They argue QV (or “Plural Voting”) *“amplif[ies] the voices of minority groups”* while balancing majority rule ([The Future of Quadratic Voting: Collaborating with RadicalxChange | by Kristin Richardson Jordan (KRJ) | Medium](https://medium.com/@kristininharlem/the-future-of-quadratic-voting-collaborating-with-radicalxchange-4ef85528d0e9#:~:text=Plural%20Voting%20offers%20an%20alternative,vote%20systems)). This stands in contrast to traditional institutions that mostly work within the confines of existing voting systems. RxC’s work on QV exemplifies its broader ethos: *empower communities through better mechanisms*. 

- **Alternative Property and Funding Models:** RadicalxChange also explores and promotes new models for ownership and funding that challenge both pure privatization and state control. For instance, they discuss **common ownership structures** and **plural funding** (quadratic funding is a mechanism to match small donations with bigger pools, favoring projects with broad support). In practice, RxC has been involved in experiments like data unions (where individuals collectively own their data) and art projects that embody these ideas. Their research wing supports **“novel decision-making and power-sharing systems”** such as these, often publishing concept papers or prototype tools ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=,scale%E2%80%9D%20citizen%20engagement%20techniques)). A current theme is *“Exit to Community” (E2C)* – encouraging startups or platforms to transition ownership to their users/communities instead of selling to monopolies. In early 2024, RxC affiliates were developing **E2C calculators** to help organizations assess readiness to democratize ownership ([The Metagovernance Project - Medium](https://medium.com/metagov#:~:text=Exit%20to%20Community%20Calculators%3A%20a,help%20organizations%20assess%20their%20E2C%E2%80%A6)). This narrative pushes back on the Silicon Valley norm of founders exiting via IPO or acquisition; instead, RadicalxChange envisions communities of users becoming stewards of the products they use (think of a social network owned by its members). By creating frameworks and even software to facilitate this, RxC is actively injecting these radical ideas into real economic decisions. The **plural ownership** narrative sets RxC apart from conventional think tanks, positing that neither pure private property nor government nationalization is always ideal – there are hybrid, community-centric options worth trying.

- **“Plurality” and Bridging Differences:** A core philosophical underpinning of RadicalxChange’s worldview is **Plurality** – the notion that society should embrace diverse identities and preferences and find ways to cooperate across them, rather than enforce uniformity or individualistic competition ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=So%20we%20need%20to%20look,accepting%20the%20legitimacy%20of%20compromises)). This leads RxC to champion mechanisms that encourage compromise and cross-community collaboration. For example, they emphasize **“listening at scale”** techniques and deliberation tools (like their *RxC Voice* platform) to gather input from large, diverse groups not just through votes but also through discourse ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=,scale%E2%80%9D%20citizen%20engagement%20techniques)). They also place importance on **social identity** in design – acknowledging people’s multifaceted identities in governance processes (as opposed to treating everyone as an identical atomized voter or consumer) ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=,scale%E2%80%9D%20citizen%20engagement%20techniques)). Recent RxC events and writings often explore how to mitigate polarization by giving people more nuanced ways to express their will, thus avoiding zero-sum outcomes. Their narrative is that better designed institutions can transform conflict into constructive cooperation. For instance, quadratic voting is said to force voters to budget their influence, discouraging tyrannies of the majority or minority; similarly, **data dividend** proposals (paying people for their data) aim to align tech companies’ incentives with users’ interests. These are *attempts to heal fractures* – economic inequality, political polarization – through design rather than through traditional partisan policy. It’s a markedly different approach from most think tanks that might propose a policy (like a tax or a law) to address inequality; RxC would propose a new market or voting system to organically produce fairer outcomes. 

**Unique Perspective:** RadicalxChange’s perspective is highly **unorthodox and forward-looking** compared to traditional policy institutions. It doesn’t fit neatly into left or right ideology – it is pro-market in the sense of using market-like mechanisms to allocate resources (quadratic pricing of votes, for example), yet it is also anti-inequality and deeply concerned with community and equality. In fact, RxC explicitly critiques both **pure free-market capitalism** (for incentivizing self-interest and externalizing harm ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=The%20best%20opportunities%20for%20liberating,challenges%20rather%20than%20solving%20them))) and classical socialism (for concentrating power) – seeking a radical middle ground of *decentralized, egalitarian mechanisms*. Its makeup as a community of not just academics and policy wonks, but also artists, activists, and technologists, is unusual ([RadicalxChange Foundation](https://www.radicalxchange.org/#:~:text=We%20are%20a%20community%20of,to%20inspire%20radical%20social%20change)). This leads to collaborations one wouldn’t see elsewhere – e.g. working with avant-garde artists to imagine new property systems, or with blockchain/Web3 developers to implement governance experiments. Where a traditional think tank might write a white paper, RadicalxChange might **write open-source code or run a civic tech pilot**. This practical, hacker mentality (they produce tools like a quadratic voting app ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=%2A%20Prototypes%3A%20We%20develop%20open,promising%20new%20directions%20in%20institutional))) gives them a niche role: they incubate ideas that later can influence policy. For instance, quadratic voting has been discussed in the context of everything from local budgeting to shareholder governance, in part due to RxC’s evangelizing. Moreover, RxC’s insistence on **“plural innovation and democratic revitalization”** ([ About - RadicalxChange ](https://www.radicalxchange.org/about/#:~:text=%2A%20Movement,plural%20innovation%20and%20democratic%20revitalization)) is a unique narrative of hope – that by empowering more voices and designing better systems, society can break out of the stale choices offered by current institutions. In essence, RadicalxChange offers a **vision of democracy and markets remixed** for the 21st century, differing from traditional institutions by focusing not on policy outputs but on *reinventing the very mechanisms that produce policy and economic outcomes*. This meta-level approach – changing the rules of the game rather than the immediate plays – sets RadicalxChange apart as a source of truly novel ideas in governance and political economy.

## The Metagovernance Project (Metagov)
The Metagovernance Project approaches the world with a **vision of self-governance for the digital age**. Its core worldview is that as more of our lives move online – from social networks and games to decentralized organizations – we need new governance tools to manage digital communities effectively, **beyond traditional government frameworks**. Metagov sees itself as building a *“governance layer for the internet that is empowering, creative, interconnected, and accountable.”* ([Metagov](https://metagov.org/#:~:text=Our%20vision)) This implies a future where online platforms and virtual communities have embedded, interoperable systems for democratic decision-making, conflict resolution, and collective choice, much like nation-states do in the offline world. The mindset is deeply experimental and inclusive: Metagov believes in cultivating open-source practices and plural participation to figure out what works for governing digital spaces. In summary, its worldview is that **digital communities deserve democratic governance too**, and that we must invent and standardize the means for them to self-govern, rather than having tech companies or chaotic dynamics dictate outcomes.

- **Tools and Infrastructure for Online Governance:** A lot of Metagov’s recent work focuses on developing practical tools and frameworks that digital communities (like open-source projects, DAOs – decentralized autonomous organizations, online forums) can use to govern themselves. For example, Metagov members have been working on **“Exit to Community” models and calculators** (in collaboration with RxC, as noted above) to help platform communities take collective ownership. They also explore technical **plug-ins for governance**, such as modular voting or proposal systems that can be added to online platforms. In 2022-2023, Metagov ran **Practical Governance workshops** bringing together developers of various Web3 and online community tools to share approaches ([The Metagovernance Project - Medium](https://medium.com/metagov#:~:text=Dec%2029%2C%202022)). One insight emerging is the importance of *designing online voting and decision processes thoughtfully* – e.g., a Metagov essay “How to Think About Voting Systems” analyzed different online voting methods and how they shape community power dynamics ([The Metagovernance Project - Medium](https://medium.com/metagov#:~:text=How%20to%20Think%20About%20Voting,Systems)). The narrative here is that governance doesn’t automatically happen online; it has to be intentionally coded and facilitated. Metagov essentially treats governance as a programmable layer. In early 2024, they launched prototypes like **“Exit to Community calculators”** (for community ownership assessment) ([The Metagovernance Project - Medium](https://medium.com/metagov#:~:text=Exit%20to%20Community%20Calculators%3A%20a,help%20organizations%20assess%20their%20E2C%E2%80%A6)), reflecting a shift from theory to application. By providing these tools and research, Metagov posits that a healthier, more democratic internet is possible – one where users collectively decide on platform rules, manage common resources, and even share platform value.

- **Research and Experimentation Network:** Metagov functions as a network of researchers and practitioners who experiment with different governance mechanisms in online contexts. It values academic rigor but also hands-on trials. For instance, Metagov’s research directors have projects on topics like DAO governance models, digital juries, and moderation policies. The organization’s **seminar series** invites people working on online governance to present findings, and they maintain a Slack community where members coordinate experiments ([Metagov](https://metagov.org/#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20to%20coordinate,by%20our%20code%20of%20conduct)) ([Metagov](https://metagov.org/#:~:text=match%20at%20L711%20to%20coordinate,by%20our%20code%20of%20conduct)). A notable theme in their research is exploring governance beyond simple token voting (which is common in blockchain communities but has flaws like plutocracy). A 2022 Metagov publication, *“Beyond DAOs: Design Decisions for Internet Organizations,”* delved into alternative designs for decentralized groups, indicating that there’s a spectrum of governance structures to consider rather than one-size-fits-all DAO code ([The Metagovernance Project - Medium](https://medium.com/metagov#:~:text=Feb%209%2C%202023)). The project also has ties to initiatives like the Stanford Digital Civil Society Lab and Ethereum Foundation ([Metagov](https://metagov.org/#:~:text=Foundation%20fil,and%20many%20Metagovernors%20through%20our%C2%A0membership)), collaborating on everything from digital constitution writing to algorithmic policy. Through this, Metagov is creating a **body of knowledge on what governance innovations are emerging online**. The narrative is that we are in a period of fertile innovation for governing virtual communities – akin to a laboratory phase – and Metagov is cataloguing and accelerating these innovations so they can coalesce into a new paradigm. 

- **Values: Openness, Inclusivity, Rigor, Experimentation:** Metagov’s own stated values shape its narrative and operations ([Metagov](https://metagov.org/#:~:text=Metagov%E2%80%99s%20core%20values%20include%3A)). It believes in openness – meaning all its work is open source or commons-based, and finances are transparent – aligning with the ethos that governance innovations should be public goods (not proprietary corporate algorithms) ([Metagov](https://metagov.org/#:~:text=,people%20and%20communities%20we%20study)). Inclusivity is key: Metagov strives to include people from different backgrounds (tech, law, art, community management) and lower the barrier to participation in its community ([Metagov](https://metagov.org/#:~:text=our%20stakeholders.%20,we%20do%2C%20drawing%20on%20scientific)). This is reflected in their communications inviting folks to join Slack or contribute, and in highlighting community members’ projects in newsletters. The **experimentation ethos** is especially prominent: *“online self-governance requires experimentation, and we seek to embody this spirit in everything we do”* ([Metagov](https://metagov.org/#:~:text=,we%20do%2C%20drawing%20on%20scientific)). For example, Metagov has helped facilitate small-scale governance experiments like collaborative drafting of community guidelines in open source projects, or trying out novel voting schemes in Discord groups. Each experiment is treated as a learning opportunity, documented and discussed. This stands in contrast to traditional governance studies that might look backward (analyzing constitutions, laws, etc.); Metagov is very forward-looking and iterative – more like a tech startup approach applied to governance itself. The narrative emerging is that *we don’t yet know the best ways to govern online spaces, but through open collaboration and trial-and-error, we can discover effective models*. This culture of innovation and humility (“learning by doing”) is something Metagov is seeding among digital communities.

**Unique Perspective:** The Metagovernance Project’s focus is almost entirely on **digital and emergent forms of governance**, which sets it apart from virtually all traditional policy think tanks that focus on nation-states or international institutions. Metagov treats **online communities as first-class citizens in the governance landscape** – asking how Ethereum’s community governs itself, or how a subreddit might make decisions, with the same seriousness others might study a city council or UN body. This is a novel perspective. Additionally, Metagov operates with a **bottom-up, decentralized approach**: rather than advocating a specific policy, it builds platforms and frameworks that let communities create their own policies. This is somewhat analogous to providing the tools for democracy rather than the content of democracy. Traditional institutions might recommend “platforms should have content moderation boards;” Metagov instead builds the toolkit for any online group to set up their own mini-judiciary or voting system. Another unique aspect is Metagov’s bridging of academia, open-source communities, and the crypto/web3 world. It’s as comfortable citing Elinor Ostrom’s principles for managing commons as it is engaging with a Discord developer group. This interdisciplinary melding results in perspectives like applying Ostrom’s ideas to blockchain DAO governance (i.e., ensuring members have shared norms and rule-making rights). While some think tanks now dabble in digital governance (often focusing on *regulating* Big Tech), Metagov’s unique twist is focusing on *enabling self-governance* – empowering users and communities directly. In sum, Metagov’s worldview and work represent a cutting-edge, somewhat idealistic bet: that **the future of governance will include networked, transnational communities governing themselves with novel digital tools**, and that we should start building the scaffolding for that future now. This is a distinctive stance that challenges traditional assumptions that governance is solely the realm of governments or that the internet must remain governed by corporate Terms of Service. By pioneering an “internet governance layer” as a public good, Metagov offers a uniquely progressive vision compared to traditional policy institutions, one that may well influence how virtual communities and perhaps eventually physical communities organize and govern in years to come.
