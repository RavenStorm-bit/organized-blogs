# Leonhard Euler’s Universe of Thought: A Thematic Journey

**Introduction**  
Leonhard Euler’s productivity and range of insight were nothing short of astonishing. The 18th-century Swiss mathematician wrote *hundreds* of treatises and papers—over 850 in total, many published posthumously—and tackled subjects as diverse as pure mathematics, astronomy, music, ship design, and theology ([About Leonhard Euler - EFMU: The Euler-Franeker Memorial University and Institute](https://euler.euclid.int/about-leonhard-euler/#:~:text=Ultimately%2C%20he%20produced%20half%20of,memory%20and%20mental%20calculation%20skills)) ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=e,11)). He claimed to have made some of his greatest discoveries “while holding a baby in his arms with other children playing round his feet” ([

    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler/#:~:text=1734%2C%20marrying%20Katharina%20Gsell%2C%20the,children%20playing%20round%20his%20feet)), and indeed his family life never slowed his intellectual output. Contemporaries marveled at Euler’s abilities: he could do elaborate calculations in his head and recite entire books from memory. After losing sight in one eye early in his career, and eventually going completely blind in 1771, Euler simply remarked, “Now I will have less distraction,” and continued to produce mathematics at the same prodigious pace ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=,Eves)). This essay offers a guided exploration into Euler’s mind and spirit by surveying his *oeuvre* thematically rather than chronologically. We will delve into Euler’s foundational work in analysis, his contributions to number theory and geometry, his reformulation of mechanics and breakthroughs in the physical sciences, his forays into music theory, his role as an educator through celebrated letters, and his philosophical and religious reflections. Along the way, we will let Euler speak in his own voice, quoting extensively from his writings (in English translation), to witness first-hand the clarity and depth of his thought. The goal is not merely to summarize Euler’s achievements, but to experience a bit of his reasoning – to see the world through Euler’s eyes – and understand how one Enlightenment genius could unify so many domains of knowledge into a single, coherent vision.

## Mathematical Analysis: Confronting the Infinite  
Euler’s most celebrated contributions lie in mathematical **analysis**, the study of continuous change and infinite processes. In the mid-18th century, calculus was still new – the tools invented by Newton and Leibniz needed rigorous foundations and systematic development. Euler rose to this challenge. His two-volume *Introductio in analysin infinitorum* (1748), or *Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite*, laid the groundwork for modern precalculus and analysis ([Introductio in analysin infinitorum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introductio_in_analysin_infinitorum#:~:text=Analysis%20of%20the%20Infinite,the%20first%20%2058%20book)) ([Introductio in analysin infinitorum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introductio_in_analysin_infinitorum#:~:text=The%20Introduction%20is%20meant%20as,4)). In its very first pages, Euler introduced a concept that would reshape mathematics: the notion of a **function**. “A function of a variable quantity is an analytic expression composed in any way whatsoever of the variable quantity and numbers or constant quantities,” he wrote ([A function of a variable quantity is an analytic expression ...](https://libquotes.com/leonhard-euler/quote/lbd2d6r#:~:text=A%20function%20of%20a%20variable,and%20numbers%20or%20constant%20quantities)). With this broad definition, Euler set the stage for treating algebraic formulas, infinite series, trigonometric and exponential expressions all under one unified idea of a function. He pioneered much of the notation we now take for granted: for example, he was first to use *f*(x) to denote a function, the letter *e* for the base of natural logarithms, *i* for $\sqrt{-1}$ (the imaginary unit), and the symbol $\Sigma$ for summation ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=Euler%20is%20credited%20for%20popularizing,displaystyle%20%5CDelta%20%7D%20%28capital)) ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=letter%20Image%3A%20,the%20bending%20of%20beams%20and)). Euler “made of this survey a masterly exercise in introducing as much as possible of analysis without using differentiation or integration,” as one historian notes ([Introductio in analysin infinitorum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introductio_in_analysin_infinitorum#:~:text=The%20Introduction%20is%20meant%20as,4)). Indeed, in the *Introductio* Euler systematically develops the exponential and logarithmic functions, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, and infinite series expansions – all *before* invoking the calculus. This tour de force included establishing the infinite series for $e^x$, $\sin x$, $\cos x$ and others, and even the famous formula $e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x$ that links exponential and trigonometric functions (Euler’s formula). By introducing $e^x$ as a function and expanding it, Euler gave the first clear definition of the constant $e$ (≈2.71828…), no longer tied to compound interest or hyperbola areas ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=letter%20Image%3A%20,the%20bending%20of%20beams%20and)). He showed how the number $e$ emerges naturally as the sum of the infinite series $1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + \cdots$, giving it the “current definition” we still use ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=letter%20Image%3A%20,the%20bending%20of%20beams%20and)).

Having laid these foundations, Euler turned to the **calculus** itself. His *Institutiones calculi differentialis* (Foundations of Differential Calculus, 1755) and *Institutiones calculi integralis* (Foundations of Integral Calculus, 1768–70) were comprehensive textbooks that organized and extended the calculus of his predecessors. In these works, Euler not only compiled known techniques for differentiation and integration but greatly expanded them: he systematically solved differential equations, introduced notation for higher-order differentials, and developed methods for integrals of various forms. He applied calculus to problems of geometry and physics, helping to cement the idea that calculus was *the* language of science. Notably, Euler was comfortable handling **infinite processes** that puzzled many of his contemporaries. He freely manipulated infinite series and products, often to stunning effect – such as his early triumph in 1735 of solving the famous Basel Problem by summing the reciprocals of the squares of the positive integers. Mathematicians had tried for decades to find the exact sum $1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{16} + \cdots$; Euler astounded the scientific world by proving it equals $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=Euler%20is%20credited%20with%20being,In%20physics%2C%20Euler)). This feat, accomplished in his late twenties, was but a hint of Euler’s adeptness with the infinite. To his peers, some of Euler’s formal arguments with infinitesimals and series seemed almost magical. But Euler had an intuitive, quasi-physical picture of these entities. “To those who ask what the infinitely small quantity in mathematics is, we answer that it is actually zero,” he wrote plainly, “Hence there are not so many mysteries hidden in this concept as they are usually believed to be” ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=,214)). In other words, what we now interpret as a limit, Euler simply treated as an extreme case of an expression – a viewpoint that, while not rigorous by modern standards, allowed him to plow forward and obtain correct results. His pragmatism demystified the calculus for an entire generation. All the while, Euler emphasized the *usefulness* of analysis: “the method of maxima and minima,” he noted, not only advances pure math “but also contributes greatly to the solution of physical problems,” because nature itself seems to follow optimization principles ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=,notable%20instances%20of%20this%20fact)). We will revisit that idea in the context of mechanics. But first, we turn from the continuum to the discrete – for Euler’s genius was equally at home with whole numbers and their patterns.

## Number Theory and the Patterns of Numbers  
In an era when number theory (the study of integers) was a minor pastime for mathematicians, Euler elevated it to a major field. He picked up the torch from Pierre de Fermat, whose tantalizing conjectures had gone largely unproved, and quickly started proving or disproving them. For example, Euler gave the first proof of **Fermat’s “little” theorem** (that $a^{p-1} ≡ 1 \pmod p$ for prime $p$) and then broadened it into **Euler’s theorem**: $a^{φ(n)} ≡ 1 \pmod{n}$ for any integer $n$ (where $φ(n)$, now called Euler’s totient, is the count of numbers up to $n$ that are coprime with $n$). This generalization laid groundwork for modern modular arithmetic ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=Euler%20is%20credited%20for%20popularizing,displaystyle%20%5CDelta%20%7D%20%28capital)). He also made breakthroughs on Fermat’s conjectures about representations of numbers: Euler proved that every integer could be written as a sum of four squares (a result Fermat claimed without proof), and he made significant progress on Fermat’s Last Theorem (proving it for the exponent $n=3$, a case that resisted others). In 1772, Euler famously discovered a **counterexample to Fermat’s conjecture** that all numbers of the form $2^{2^m}+1$ (Fermat numbers) are prime – he found that $2^{32}+1 = 4294967297$ is in fact **not** prime but equals $641 \times 6700417$. By spotting this factor, Euler dashed a hopeful pattern and showed his unmatched acuity with huge numbers.

One of Euler’s great loves was the **sequence of prime numbers**, those indivisible atoms of arithmetic. He pushed the subject into analytic territory by considering the interplay between primes and infinite series. For instance, Euler showed that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes diverges, linking prime distribution to the zeta function (a precursor to Riemann’s work a century later). Yet he also had the humility to recognize the depth of prime mysteries. “Mathematicians have tried in vain to this day to discover some order in the sequence of prime numbers,” he admitted, “and we have reason to believe that it is a mystery into which the human mind will never penetrate” ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=order%20%20in%20the%20sequence,Simmons)). This remarkably prescient statement (primes remain notoriously inscrutable) reflects Euler’s blend of optimism and realism: he solved many problems but acknowledged those he found intractable. Euler introduced novel techniques to number theory, such as generating functions (expressing sequences as coefficients in power series) to tackle problems in partitions (ways to write integers as sums) and combinatorics. In a 1741 paper, he derived a formula for the number of partitions of an integer – an early use of what we now call the Euler generating function. He was also a master of classical Diophantine analysis, finding elegant formulas for things like **amicable numbers** (pairs of numbers each of which is the sum of the proper divisors of the other) and discovering dozens of new examples of such pairs.

Euler’s penchant for pattern extended beyond numbers into geometry and topology. In 1736, he solved the famous **Seven Bridges of Königsberg** puzzle, proving it impossible to traverse all bridges exactly once, and in doing so essentially founded **graph theory** and network topology ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=Euler%20is%20credited%20with%20being,In%20physics%2C%20Euler)). This solution was the first theorem in graph theory and foreshadowed the idea of Eulerian paths. Decades later, in 1750, Euler published a theorem connecting the vertices, edges, and faces of polyhedra: $V - E + F = 2$ for any convex polyhedron. This formula, now known as the **Euler characteristic**, is a foundational result in topology ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=in%20number%20theory%20and%20analysis%2C,In%20physics%2C%20Euler)). Euler himself was delighted by the discovery, as it unified all sorts of 3D shapes under a simple invariant. From the loftiest heights of infinite series to the solid count of geometric elements, Euler’s insight tied together disparate realms of mathematics. His ability to see structure where others saw chaos is perhaps best summed up by another of his quotes: *“Although to penetrate into the intimate mysteries of nature and thence to learn the true causes of phenomena is not allowed to us, nevertheless it can happen that a certain fictive hypothesis may suffice for explaining many phenomena.”* ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=ImageAlthough%20to%20penetrate%20into%20the,suffice%20for%20explaining%20many%20phenomena)) In number theory, his “fictive hypotheses” were often heuristic leaps that yielded correct results. By the time of his later years, Euler had proved so many theorems and introduced so many concepts that the subject of number theory had been utterly transformed – setting the stage for Gauss and others to later build on “the master of us all.”

## Mechanics and the Physics of Motion  
To the public of his day, Euler was equally renowned as a **physicist** and astronomer. He took the new calculus and applied it broadly to the “natural philosophy” problems of motion, forces, and orbits. In fact, Euler’s 1736 work *Mechanica* (written in Latin, full title: *Mechanica sive motus scientia analytice exposita*) rewrote Newton’s mechanics in the language of analysis ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=has%20also%20been%20credited%20for,motion%20of%20%20286%20rigid)). Where Newton’s *Principia* had used geometric arguments, Euler’s *Mechanica* expressed laws of motion with differential equations and calculus, making them more general and easier to extend. He introduced concepts like **generalized coordinates** and made implicit use of energy principles. In the preface to *Mechanica*, Euler outlined an ambitious program to apply mathematical analysis to *every* branch of physics ([www.17centurymaths.com](https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/mechanica1.html#:~:text=giving%20us%20our%20understanding%20of,ever%20been%20so%20well%20equipped)) ([www.17centurymaths.com](https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/mechanica1.html#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20a%20summary%20of,Thus%2C%20in%20this)). This program would occupy him for decades and lead to numerous breakthroughs.

A cornerstone of Euler’s physical thought was the idea (mentioned earlier) that nature follows extremal or optimal principles. In a 1744 essay on the calculus of variations, Euler stated: “the fabric of the universe is most perfect, and is the work of a most wise Creator, [so] nothing whatsoever takes place in the universe in which some relation of maximum and minimum does not appear” ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=,notable%20instances%20of%20this%20fact)). In other words, whether it’s the path of a light ray, the shape of a hanging chain, or the orbit of a planet, one can often characterize it by a variational principle (least time, least potential energy, etc.). This insight was a physical philosophy – part science, part theology – that guided Euler’s work. It led him (independently of Lagrange) to derive the **Euler–Lagrange equation** in calculus of variations, which underpins modern mechanics. Euler applied these ideas to solve the **brachistochrone problem** (the curve of quickest descent under gravity) and to understand the physics of elastic beams and vibrating membranes.

Euler’s contributions to **rigid body dynamics** were especially influential. He was the first to correctly formulate the equations of motion for a rotating rigid body (the famous **Euler’s equations** in rotational dynamics). He introduced the concept of **Euler angles** to describe an object’s orientation in 3D space, and he worked out the motion of spinning tops and the Earth’s precession. In fluid dynamics, Euler derived in 1755 the **Euler equations** for inviscid fluid flow, which are the foundation of hydrodynamics ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=notation%20%2C%20including%20the%20notion,then%20the%20capital%20of%20Prussia)). These partial differential equations generalize Newton’s second law to fluid motion and are still in use (they reduce to the Navier–Stokes equations when viscosity is added). With these, Euler could explain wave propagation in fluids and the speed of sound. In fact, Euler was deeply interested in **acoustics** (as we’ll see in the next section) and he connected his fluid equations to the transmission of sound waves through air. 

In **astronomy**, Euler was a towering figure as well. He calculated the orbits of comets and planets with unprecedented accuracy, helping to establish Newton’s gravitational law empirically. He assisted Alexis Clairaut and Joseph Lalande in working out the perturbations in the Moon’s orbit (due to the Sun’s influence), a complex three-body problem; their joint effort won the 1753 Paris Academy Prize ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=Euler%20to%20permit%20his%20son,I%20turned%20most%20of%20my)). Euler later produced lunar tables that improved navigation, and he correctly computed the orbit of the newly discovered planet Uranus in the 1780s. It was Euler who recommended the method of **lunar distances** for finding longitude at sea, and his astronomical calculations were used in the Nautical Almanac. Few realize that Euler even proposed a space telescope of sorts – calculating, for instance, the optimal shape of mirrors for reflecting telescopes.

Beyond celestial mechanics, Euler applied his analytical skill to practical engineering problems. In the field of **structural mechanics**, he developed the **Euler-Bernoulli beam theory** (building on ideas from Daniel Bernoulli) to describe how beams bend under loads. He derived the formula for the **critical buckling load** of a column (Euler’s critical load), an equation still taught in engineering: $P_\text{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$ for a column of length $L$. This work on elastic stability was far ahead of its time ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=mathematics%20%20and%20engineering%20%2C,11)). It was said that Euler’s contemporaries sometimes struggled to keep up with him – an anecdote goes that when Euler was once challenged on a complex vibrating-string problem, he effortlessly produced an answer using his general methods, prompting the commentator to exclaim that Euler calculated as naturally “as men breathe” ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=and%20whose%20extraordinary%20mathematical%20prowess,Euler%2C%20Letters)). Through *Mechanica* and dozens of papers, Euler turned dynamics into a precise science. Newton had been the pioneer, but Euler was the systematizer who showed how to *solve* the equations of motion in case after case, from spinning tops to flowing fluids to oscillating springs. In doing so, he set the stage for all later developments in theoretical physics. Notably, Euler’s work in mechanics often intersected with his philosophical beliefs: effective causes (forces) and final causes (optimization principles) were, to him, two sides of the same coin explaining why “every effect in the universe can be explained as satisfactorily from final causes… as it can from the effective causes themselves” ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=also%20contributes%20greatly%20to%20the,in%20any%20field%20of%20Natural)). This holistic view fueled his confidence that mathematics could unlock nature’s secrets.

## Optics and Engineering: Light, Vision, and Ships  
Leonhard Euler did not restrict his scientific curiosity to the abstract or celestial; he was equally engaged with the tangible problems of **light** and **industry**. In the realm of **optics**, Euler weighed in on one of the great debates of the day – whether light is a stream of particles (Newton’s view) or a wave (Huygens’ view). Newton’s corpuscular theory had dominated early 18th-century optics, but Euler bravely challenged it. “Euler made important contributions in optics,” one historical review notes. “He disagreed with Newton’s corpuscular theory of light, which was the prevailing theory of the time. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light… would become the dominant mode of thought” ([Leonhard Euler: Popularizing Pi and Other Mathematical Advances in the 18th Century](https://brewminate.com/leonhard-euler-popularizing-pi-and-other-mathematical-advances-in-the-18th-century/#:~:text=Euler%20made%20important%20contributions%20in%C2%A0optics.,the%20dominant%20mode%20of%20thought)). In a series of letters and papers (notably *Nova theoria lucis et colorum*, 1746), Euler argued that the phenomena of diffraction and refraction were more naturally explained by a wave model. He pointed out inconsistencies in Newton’s ideas about how the eye focuses light, and he championed a wave-based explanation for the **blue color of the sky** (due to scattering). Euler’s work in optics was theoretical, but it had practical impact. He tackled the problem of **chromatic aberration** in telescopes – the blurring caused by lenses bending different colors unequally. Newton had thought chromatic aberration unavoidable for lenses (hence he preferred mirror telescopes), but Euler suggested that by combining two different types of glass, one could make an achromatic lens. English optician John Dollond took up this suggestion and succeeded in creating achromatic lenses for telescopes by 1758 ([Leonhard Euler: Popularizing Pi and Other Mathematical Advances in the 18th Century](https://brewminate.com/leonhard-euler-popularizing-pi-and-other-mathematical-advances-in-the-18th-century/#:~:text=Euler%20made%20important%20contributions%20in%C2%A0optics.,the%20dominant%20mode%20of%20thought)). Euler, who corresponded with Dollond, was gratified that a mathematical idea led to a concrete invention improving microscopes and telescopes ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=e,11)). In his *Dioptrica* (three volumes on optics, 1769–71), Euler presented a wide-ranging theory of lenses, vision, and optical instruments, contributing significantly to the design of precision optics.

Euler’s talents also extended to what we would today call **engineering** and naval architecture. In 1727, as a young man, he entered a Paris Academy competition on the optimal placement of masts on a ship – a highly practical problem for maximizing a sailing ship’s speed and stability. Euler won second prize (losing only to the famed Pierre Bouguer) despite, as he wryly noted, never having seen an ocean-going ship at that point ([About Leonhard Euler - EFMU: The Euler-Franeker Memorial University and Institute](https://euler.euclid.int/about-leonhard-euler/#:~:text=Euler%20finished%20his%20studies%20at,ship%20before%2C%20won%20second%20place)) ([About Leonhard Euler - EFMU: The Euler-Franeker Memorial University and Institute](https://euler.euclid.int/about-leonhard-euler/#:~:text=concerning%20the%20optimal%20placement%20of,ship%20before%2C%20won%20second%20place)). This early effort presaged Euler’s later work on ships. In the 1740s he wrote a fundamental two-volume treatise on naval science, *Scientia Navalis*, analyzing the equilibrium and oscillations of ships. He modeled a ship as a floating body and derived equations for its stability against rolling – essentially founding the field of ship hydrodynamics. Euler’s study of ships “helped navigation” and set design principles for shipbuilders ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=e,11)). It was another example of Euler turning a practical question into a mathematical one: he treated the ship’s cross-section as a curve, computed buoyant forces via calculus, and determined how a slight tilt would produce a righting moment. This analysis yielded conditions for stability that naval architects could use. In addition, while at the St. Petersburg Academy, Euler was frequently consulted on engineering projects. He worked on problems of ballistics (how cannonballs fly) and devised pumping mechanisms for water supply. His knowledge was sought in areas like cartography and geography – he even introduced a new map projection (the Euler–Angles projection). 

In 1757, Euler wrote an important memoir on the **flexure of beams**, establishing the relationship between load, bending moment, and curvature (essentially $M = EI\kappa$, with $E$ the elastic modulus and $I$ the moment of inertia of the cross-section). This became a cornerstone of civil engineering. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Euler was the **engineer’s mathematician** of the 18th century: many formulas and design rules in mechanics and engineering bear his imprint, from the Euler critical load in columns to the Euler angles in kinematics. His ability to marry theory with practice was rare. A colleague joked that Euler could calculate anything – once he even computed, on the spot, the exact date and time of an annular solar eclipse for a skeptical acquaintance (and was correct). Whether it was calibrating sights for artillery or determining the best shape of a ship’s hull, Euler was the authority to turn to. And his approach was always the same: set up the equations derived from physical laws, solve them with ingenious mathematical methods, and interpret the results in practical terms. By doing this repeatedly, Euler helped transform fields like optics and shipbuilding from crafts based on trial-and-error into sciences grounded in mathematics. His success in applications also reinforced his philosophy that “the works of the Creator infinitely surpass the productions of human skill” ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=wind%E2%80%9D%20%28Eves%2C%20p,man%3F%20What%20were%20their%20origins)) – an expression of his view that nature’s designs, which he sought to unveil with math, were ultimately superior to any human engineering, however clever.

## Sound and Music: From Vibrations to Harmony  
Music and mathematics have long been linked, but Euler took this connection to unprecedented depths. As both a physicist and a musician at heart, he studied **sound** scientifically and **music** aesthetically, producing original contributions to each. In physics, Euler’s 1727 essay on acoustics (written when he was just 19, in an unsuccessful bid for a Basel professorship) became a classic in the theory of sound ([
      Leonhard Euler  (1707 - 1783) - Biography - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler/#:~:text=He%20wanted%20time%20to%20study,24%5D%20suggests)). He considered air as made of elastic particles and described how vibrations travel through it – essentially an early wave model of sound propagation. In a later memoir *De sono* (On Sound, 1741), Euler derived the relationship between the pitch of a musical note and the frequency of air vibration. “It is low [or bass in music] when the vibrations of the air globules follow each other more slowly… But the sound is high [or treble] the briefer vibrations of which have smaller delays between them,” he explained ([Chapter I](https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/euler/e002tr.pdf#:~:text=the%20trembling%20motion%20of%20that,small%20size%2C%20and%20which%20hence)) ([Chapter I](https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/euler/e002tr.pdf#:~:text=depend%20on%20an%20indefinitely%20short,that%20kind%20in%20the%20air)). He noted that the ear can only perceive vibrations up to a certain speed and that beyond that, sound turns into noise. In fact, Euler asserted that the human ear cannot discern individual vibrations once they exceed about **30 per second**, which is why extremely low frequencies cease to sound like distinct tones ([Explanation of the Musical Scale - jstor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25121221.pdf#:~:text=Explanation%20of%20the%20Musical%20Scale,of%20less%20than%20thirty)). This is a remarkably accurate observation (the modern threshold of hearing is around 20 Hz). Euler’s analysis of organ pipes, strings, and sound pulses laid groundwork for later physicists like Fourier and Helmholtz. Always, he combined theoretical models with practical examples – describing, for instance, how a drum produces sound lacking a definite pitch because its vibrations are too complex, or why a bell in a vacuum cannot be heard (since it needs air to transmit the vibrations).

Yet Euler’s fascination with sound went beyond physics into the realm of **music theory and harmony**. He was an accomplished lutenist and always retained a love for music. In 1739, he published *Tentamen novae theoriae musicae* (“Attempt at a New Theory of Music”), a bold treatise that tried to put the principles of musical harmony on a mathematical foundation. Euler approached music as a branch of applied mathematics: just as he sought the laws of nature in mechanics, he sought the laws of beauty in combinations of tones. The central question he posed was simple yet profound: *“Whence is it that a fine piece of music excites a sentiment of pleasure?”* ([

    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20question%20as,the%20order%20which%20pervades%20it)). Opinions varied, as he noted: some said musical taste is purely arbitrary (“mere caprice”), others thought the pleasure comes from perceiving an *order* in the notes ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20question%20as,the%20order%20which%20pervades%20it)). Euler leaned toward the latter – that the enjoyment of music arises from recognizing patterns – but he didn’t stop there. He introduced the concept of the **“Gradus Suavitatis”** (degree of pleasantness) to quantify the harmony of an interval or chord. Essentially, Euler assigned a numerical score to every rational ratio of frequencies: intervals corresponding to simple ratios (like 2:1 octave, 3:2 fifth) scored low *gradus* (meaning *high* pleasantness), whereas more complex ratios (like 16:15 or minor second) scored high *gradus* (low pleasantness). This way, he created a scale of consonance and dissonance based on the prime factors of the frequency ratio ([Gradus Suavitatis, Music and Mathematics - Mathematik.com](https://mathematik.com/Piano/#:~:text=Gradus%20Suavitatis%2C%20Music%20and%20Mathematics,degree%20of%20pleasure)). For example, an octave (2:1) had a gradus suavitatis of 1 (very consonant), a fifth (3:2) a bit higher, and so on, with dissonant intervals getting large numbers. Euler then tried to extend this to chords and even to entire pieces of music by considering the combined harmony and rhythm.

In his letters on music to the Princess (written in the early 1760s), Euler presents these ideas in a more accessible way. He explains that music has two fundamental dimensions of order: **harmony** (the ratios of vibration frequencies producing intervals) and **rhythm** or measure (the durations of notes) ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=This%20opinion%20appears%20at%20first,that%20of%204%20to%205)) ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=another%2C%20especially%20when%20the%20relations,relations%20which%20result%20from%20it)). A skilled listener perceives the mathematical relations in both aspects. “Thus the connoisseur who hears a piece of music, and who comprehends, by the acute perception of his ear, all the proportions on which both the harmony and the measure are founded, has certainly the most perfect knowledge possible of that music,” Euler writes ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=The%20drum%20and%20tymbal%20furnish,in%20part%2C%20or%20not%20at)). However – and here Euler’s psychological insight shines – merely *comprehending* the pattern is not enough for pleasure. “The sentiment of pleasure excited by fine music, must not be confounded with the knowledge… though it may be confidently affirmed, that a piece of music cannot produce any [pleasure], unless the relations of it are perceived,” he notes. “For this knowledge alone is not sufficient to excite the sentiment of pleasure; something more is wanting, which no one hitherto has unfolded” ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=music%3A%20while%20another%2C%20who%20perceives,no%20one%20hitherto%20has%20unfolded)). That “something more,” Euler suggests, is an intermediate level of complexity: music should be neither too simple (which makes it trivial) nor too complex (which makes it unintelligible) ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20be%C2%A0convinced%20that,must%2C%20if%20I%20may%20use)). The listener’s mind should strain a little to grasp the pattern, and in doing so, feel a reward. In modern terms, Euler anticipated the idea that aesthetic pleasure comes from an optimal balance of **predictability and surprise**.

Euler’s *Tentamen* was not widely embraced by practicing musicians – it was perhaps too mathematical and ahead of its time. Yet it was a pioneering attempt to quantify musical aesthetics. He applied his gradus suavitatis formula to analyze scales and tuning systems, advocating for a 18-note scale to maximize harmony (though that idea didn’t catch on). Even his failures were thought-provoking: Euler struggled with the concept of **musical dissonance** that is contextually resolved (a dissonant chord that sounds pleasing in a progression). This showed him that musical beauty cannot be entirely captured by static ratios; the temporal context matters too. In his later years, Euler even mused about a theory of **rhythm**, suggesting that the pleasure from rhythmic patterns might be analyzed similarly to harmony (with small integer ratios of durations) ([Leonhard Euler's Unfinished Theory of Rhythm - ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274354272_Leonhard_Euler's_Unfinished_Theory_of_Rhythm#:~:text=Leonhard%20Euler%27s%20Unfinished%20Theory%20of,everything%20he%20has%20written)) ([Euler Transgressing limits: the Infinite and Music Theory](https://www.academia.edu/28826100/Euler_Transgressing_limits_the_Infinite_and_Music_Theory#:~:text=Published%20in%201739%20as%20the,preface)). He never fully developed this, but he had essentially planted seeds for the future field of music psychology.

In sum, Euler’s investigations in acoustics and music exemplify his drive to find **order in complexity**. Just as he brought the infinite within reach in analysis, and order to prime numbers, here he sought the hidden numerical structure in a Bach fugue or a folk melody. And characteristically, he did it by both **experiment (thought-experiment, in this case)** and **analysis**: for instance, he built up chords from basic intervals, computed their gradus suavitatis, and compared it to what a listener feels. In one letter, he even daydreams about a mechanical device that could mimic human speech – essentially an early idea of a speech synthesizer. “It would be a considerable invention indeed, that of a machine able to mimic speech, with its sounds and articulations. … I think it is not impossible,” he told the Princess ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=%2C%20avec%20toutes%20les%20articulations,Speech%20Synthesis%20%282001%29%20by%20Thierry)). (Indeed, such a machine was attempted a few decades later by Wolfgang von Kempelen.) This mix of fanciful vision and quantitative reasoning is pure Euler. His work on sound and music might be considered *lesser-known*, but it was deeply characteristic of his genius: he takes something subjective (the sweetness of music) and breaks it into objective components without losing sight of the whole experience. As a result, we have from Euler both a scientific legacy in acoustics – the wave equation and Fourier analysis owe much to his early formulations – and a humanistic legacy in the philosophy of music.

## Letters and Pedagogy: Euler as Enlightenment Educator  
Despite his fame as a mathematician, Euler was by temperament a patient teacher. Nowhere is this more evident than in his celebrated *Letters to a German Princess*. These letters, written between 1760 and 1762 to Princess Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt (the niece of Frederick the Great), form a remarkable **popular science and philosophy course** in epistolary form. Over 230 letters, Euler covered topics ranging from the nature of space and time to the functioning of the lungs, from logic and the soul to the laws of motion. The Princess was only fifteen when the correspondence began, and Euler took care to explain things in clear, gentle language, often starting from first principles. “The hope of having the honour to communicate in person to Your Highness my lessons in geometry becoming more and more distant… I feel myself impelled to supply personal instruction by writing, as far as the nature of the subjects will permit,” he writes in the very first letter ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=1)). With that, Euler begins an extraordinary course by mail, effectively homeschooling a royal teenager in the fundamentals of 18th-century knowledge. 

The *Letters* are organized into three volumes. The first volume focuses on **physics and the natural world**: Euler begins with basic concepts of magnitude and motion, gradually introducing gravity, planetary orbits, the shape of the Earth, and the properties of air, water, and light. In one early letter “On Velocity,” for instance, he explains the concept of speed by comparing a horseman and a pedestrian, calculating how many feet per second each travels ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=other%20on%20foot%2C%20proceed%20from,exceeds%20that%20of%20the%20latter)) ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=in%20travelling%20the%20same%20distance,a%20certain%20quantity%20of%20time)). He even measures his own walking pace (“120 steps in a minute, each step 2½ feet, so 300 feet per minute”) to give concrete examples ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20know%20the,by%20a%20greater%20or%20less)). Such relatable scenarios pervade the letters. When discussing the speed of sound, Euler notes that sound travels about 1000 feet per second, so “were a cannon to be fired at Magdeburg… if the report could be heard at [Berlin],” one could count the time delay to gauge distance ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=at%20the%20rate%20of%2010,blow%20from%20hence%20to%20Magdeburg)). Volume II of the letters delves into **philosophy, metaphysics, and logic** – here Euler tackles the nature of matter, the question of atoms versus continuum, the structure of the soul, the principles of knowledge, and even a primer on reasoning (syllogisms and the like). Volume III gets into **moral philosophy and theology**, discussing God, the immortality of the soul, the problem of evil, and the reasons for religious belief.

What makes Euler’s *Letters* so engaging is his conversational tone and use of analogy. He writes as if sitting in the room with the Princess, anticipating her questions. For example, to explain the vastness of space, he asks her to imagine traveling from Earth to the Sun and how long it would take at various speeds ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=I%20begin%20my%20attempt%20by,we%20have%20that%20also%20of)) ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=The%20question%2C%20then%2C%20is%3A%20Wherein,space%20which%20another%20body%20does)). To convey the concept of air pressure, he describes amusing experiments with suction pumps and flickering candles under a bell jar. On the topic of light, he patiently compares Newton’s theory (light as fast particles) and Descartes’ theory (light as pressure in an ether), guiding the Princess through the evidence for each ([www.17centurymaths.com](http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/lettersvol1.html#:~:text=Letters%20XVII%20,6)) ([www.17centurymaths.com](http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/lettersvol1.html#:~:text=Letters%20XXXIV%20,reflection%20%26%20refraction%3B%20the%20eye)). He does not shy away from stating his own positions – for instance, his preference for the wave theory of light – but he always tries to present opposing views fairly. In doing so, Euler’s letters embody the **Enlightenment spirit of inquiry**, tempered by his own devout perspective. They were immensely successful. Published in French in the late 1760s and quickly translated into multiple languages (English in 1795 by Henry Hunter), Euler’s *Letters* became one of the most popular science books of the era ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=First%20published%20in%20three%20volumes,Hunter%20wrote%20in%20the%20Preface)). They brought serious scientific discussions into salons and drawing rooms across Europe. As one translator envisioned, “the time, I trust, is at hand, when the Letters of Euler… will be daily on the breakfasting table, in the parlour of every female academy in the kingdom” ([
      Euler letters to a princess - MacTutor History of Mathematics
    ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Euler_letters/#:~:text=%281741,Hunter%20wrote%20in%20the%20Preface)) – a somewhat dated sentiment, but it underscores how Euler’s clear explanations were seen as *accessible to all*, not just to men of science.

Euler covered some delightfully **innovative topics** in these letters. For instance, decades before the first real speech machines, Euler speculated about the possibility of imitating the human voice mechanically. In a 1761 letter, he wrote: “It would be a considerable invention indeed, that of a machine able to mimic speech, with its sounds and articulations. … I think it is not impossible.” ([Leonhard Euler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=%2C%20avec%20toutes%20les%20articulations,Speech%20Synthesis%20%282001%29%20by%20Thierry)). He then discussed how vowel sounds might be produced by pipes and how consonants might be mechanically formed – essentially anticipating the field of speech synthesis. In another letter, Euler gave a simple introduction to **logic** and set theory using what are now called **Eulerian circles** or diagrams (the predecessors of Venn diagrams) ([Leonhard Euler: Popularizing Pi and Other Mathematical Advances in the 18th Century](https://brewminate.com/leonhard-euler-popularizing-pi-and-other-mathematical-advances-in-the-18th-century/#:~:text=relationships,that%20are%20not%20members%20of)). He taught the Princess how to categorize things and visualize logical relations with overlapping circles – a didactic tool still used today. He also dove into **astronomical controversies**, explaining why some believed in an infinite universe with countless stars, while others wondered if the universe might be finite – all before the advent of modern cosmology. On more practical matters, Euler’s letters include explanations of **tides**, **maps**, **the calendar**, **electricity** (just emerging as a subject of fascination in the 18th century), and even the probability of lucky guesses.

Aside from the letters, Euler demonstrated his pedagogical gift in other writings too. In the 1760s, nearly blind, he composed his *Elements of Algebra* – an elementary textbook that introduces algebra in a very accessible manner. It starts with simple arithmetic and gradully moves to solving equations, and it remained in use well into the 19th century. Euler succeeded in something few great mathematicians do: **communicating complexity with simplicity**. His letters and textbooks avoided heavy technical language, yet they did not dumb down the content. This balance is why Euler is sometimes called the **teacher of Europe** in the Enlightenment. Young Carl Friedrich Gauss, for example, was given Euler’s works to study as a boy; Gauss later remarked that *Euler’s writings “will remain the best school”* ([Leonhard Euler: Popularizing Pi and Other Mathematical Advances in the 18th Century](https://brewminate.com/leonhard-euler-popularizing-pi-and-other-mathematical-advances-in-the-18th-century/#:~:text=greatest%20of%20the%2018th%20century,when%20completed%2C%20will%20consist%20of)) for learning mathematics. Euler seemed to relish explaining God’s creation to others as much as he did investigating it himself. And unlike some savants, he had infinite patience for basic questions. When the Princess – or rather Euler, speaking in her voice – asks why heavy and light bodies fall at the same rate, Euler carefully recounts Galileo’s Leaning Tower experiment and the principle of inertia. When she inquires how we see colors, Euler leads her through the decomposition of white light. Always, he builds from everyday experience (a dropped stone, a rainbow) to general principle. It is science teaching in its purest form.

Through these correspondences, Euler also reveals something of his **character and beliefs**, which leads us naturally to examine his philosophical and religious outlook. The letters gradually shift from physical to metaphysical topics, as Euler no doubt sensed the Princess’s growing maturity and interest in deeper questions. In these later letters we see Euler as a man of the Enlightenment *and* a man of faith – roles he wore without contradiction.

## Philosophy and Faith: Reason in the Service of God  
Leonhard Euler was a devout Christian in an age when many intellectuals were increasingly skeptical of religion. Far from hiding his beliefs, he actively defended them in writing, striving to reconcile **faith with reason**. His philosophical and religious ideas come through most clearly in the later letters to the German Princess and in a few theological essays he penned. Euler’s worldview was one of *order and purpose*: he saw the hand of a Creator in the harmony of the cosmos and the laws of mathematics. As we have seen, he often invoked the perfection of creation as an explanation for why physical phenomena follow optimal rules (like minima and maxima). “The works of the Creator infinitely surpass the productions of human skill,” Euler asserted ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=wind%E2%80%9D%20%28Eves%2C%20p,man%3F%20What%20were%20their%20origins)). To him, studying science was a way to admire God’s craftsmanship. He was deeply convinced of the **truth of Christianity**, referring unabashedly to “the divinity of the Holy Scripture” and “the divine sending of Christ into the world” as fundamental truths ([The God-Fearing Life of Leonhard Euler – ACMS](https://acmsonline.org/journal-2/journal-archives/2006-journal/the-god-fearing-life-of-leonhard-euler/#:~:text=exists%20at%20all,the%20Enlightenment%20is%20indeed%20noteworthy)).

One famous anecdote, perhaps apocryphal but emblematic, has Euler confronting the French philosopher Denis Diderot at the court of Catherine the Great. Diderot was a skeptic causing a stir at court with atheistic arguments, so Euler was supposedly asked to respond. Euler, the story goes, approached Diderot and solemnly declared, *“Sir, $(a + b^n)/n = x$, therefore God exists.”* Diderot, confounded by the mathematical jargon and assuming it was a valid proof he lacked the wit to refute, allegedly left Russia in embarrassment. This witty tale (likely embellished by later storytellers) captures Euler’s popular image as a pious savant who could dispatch atheists with a flourish of algebra. In reality, Euler’s defense of faith was far more nuanced and thorough than that joke implies. In 1746, he wrote an entire book, *Apologia pro Revelatione* (Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of Freethinkers), systematically countering the era’s deist and atheist arguments ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=Freethinkers,in%20the%20employ%20of%20and)) ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=Freethinkers%2C%20Euler%20vigorously%20opposed%20a,need%20to%20be%20unmistakable%20and)). For instance, against those who found **contradictions in Scripture** and thus dismissed it, Euler pointed out that apparent contradictions exist in nature too, yet scientists don’t throw out nature’s testimony – they seek deeper understanding ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L484%20Because%20of,equal%20or%20greater%20magnitude%20found)) ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=Because%20of%20apparent%20contradictions%20they,equal%20or%20greater%20magnitude%20found)). Likewise, he argued, one should seek to resolve Bible difficulties rather than reject revelation outright ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L509%20The%20freethinkers,Flatly)).

In his letters on metaphysics to the Princess, Euler challenged fashionable ideas like Leibniz’s monads and pre-established harmony, and the materialist notion (espoused by philosophers like La Mettrie) that the soul is just a physical machine. Euler found these notions contrary to both reason and moral intuition ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=Freethinkers,in%20the%20employ%20of%20and)). He maintained the **soul’s immateriality** and freedom, aligning with his devout Lutheran upbringing. On the classic problem of **evil** – how a good God can allow suffering – Euler’s Letter 110 offers a thoughtful perspective. He suggests that what appears as evil may be permitted for a greater good, or as a consequence of human free will, and that without freedom there could be no virtue. While he doesn’t claim to “solve” the problem of evil, he tries to show it’s not inconsistent with an all-good Deity. Euler’s tone in these religious letters is not fire-and-brimstone; it’s calm, rational, and often compassionate. He writes as a man who has thought deeply and finds comfort in his faith. When discussing the **existence of God**, Euler appeals to the magnificence of creation and the inner moral law. The order of the universe, he argues, “cannot be the effect of chance” – it points to an intelligent Cause. And the universality of moral conscience in humans suggests a higher moral Governor.

One charming aspect is how Euler tailored even these heavy topics to his young pupil. He uses analogies a teen might grasp. To explain the soul’s independence from the body, Euler imagines a machine performing calculations – no matter how complex the machine (body), it cannot by itself generate understanding (soul); something extra is needed. In another letter, he reassures the Princess about **the afterlife** by reasoning that God’s justice and goodness imply the soul’s immortality, since virtue must ultimately be rewarded and vice punished if the world is to be morally coherent. Such arguments were typical of Enlightenment Christian apologetics, but Euler delivered them with clarity and sincerity that impressed even secular readers of the letters.

It is interesting that Euler remained on good terms with secular Enlightenment figures (he corresponded with Voltaire and others) despite openly refuting many of their ideas. Part of this was Euler’s personality – he was described as a humble, gentle man, devoid of arrogance. He focused on his work and avoided personal quarrels (the alleged Diderot incident aside, which if it happened was likely a lighthearted jest rather than malicious). Even Frederick the Great, who favored French philosophers and once mocked Euler as a “mathematical cyclops” (a jab at his blindness and perceived dullness in conversation), respected Euler’s genius. When Euler left Berlin in 1766 to return to Russia, Frederick wrote him a warm farewell, acknowledging his contributions to the Berlin Academy.

In Euler’s mind, **reason and faith were harmonious**. He lived comfortably in both worlds. While he proved theorems in number theory, he also wrote about God with the same matter-of-fact confidence. This synthesis might puzzle us today, but in Euler’s era it was not uncommon – many great scientists (from Descartes to Newton) were deeply religious. Euler stands out, however, for how directly he engaged the skeptics using their own tools of logic. He was a *Christian Enlightener*, using the new science not to undermine faith but to bolster it. For example, after discussing the vastness of the universe in the letters – which might make one feel insignificant – Euler concludes that the grandeur of creation only magnifies the wisdom of the Creator, and thus should strengthen, not weaken, our belief. To Euler, every new discovery was “thinking God’s thoughts after Him,” a phrase sometimes associated with him (though originally Kepler’s sentiment). 

A moving anecdote from Euler’s final days: On September 18, 1783, after a morning of calculations on the orbit of Uranus and a discussion over tea about the recently discovered planet, 76-year-old Euler suffered a brain hemorrhage and died within a few hours ([About Leonhard Euler - EFMU: The Euler-Franeker Memorial University and Institute](https://euler.euclid.int/about-leonhard-euler/#:~:text=By%201766%2C%20Euler%E2%80%99s%20relations%20with,memory%20and%20mental%20calculation%20skills)). The Reverend who was present reported that Euler’s last words were to commend his soul to God. The Academy obituary noted that “he lived as a Christian, and as a Christian he died.” Whatever one’s personal beliefs, it’s clear Euler drew great strength and ethical direction from his faith. It guided his personal life (he was by all accounts kind, generous, and devout) and provided him a framework in which the universe made sense. The same man who tamed infinity with a formula and solved polynomial equations that stumped others also found time every day for Bible reading and prayer. Euler’s life thus exemplified a **fusion of rational inquiry and spiritual devotion** that was increasingly rare in his century. In our age of specialization, it’s hard to imagine a single person equally at home proving abstract theorems, designing ships, explaining music, and debating theology – but Euler was all of that and more.

**Conclusion: Euler’s Enduring Legacy**  
Leonhard Euler’s legacy is as vast and multifaceted as his output. In mathematics, scarcely an area exists that he did not touch: calculus of variations, complex analysis, number theory, geometry, algebra, probability – all were enriched by Euler’s results and notation. He introduced the world to the **beauty of $e$**, the **mystery of $i$**, and the elegant shorthand of $f(x)$ and $\Sigma$ ([Leonhard Euler - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#:~:text=Euler%20is%20credited%20for%20popularizing,displaystyle%20%5CDelta%20%7D%20%28capital)). Euler’s identity $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, which he derived as a simple corollary of Euler’s formula, has been called “the most beautiful equation” for linking five fundamental constants ([About Leonhard Euler - EFMU: The Euler-Franeker Memorial University and Institute](https://euler.euclid.int/about-leonhard-euler/#:~:text=Some%20of%20Euler%E2%80%99s%20most%20notable,contributions%20include)). But beyond specific formulas, Euler’s true legacy is the example of a **unified mind**. He showed that the pursuit of truth in science and mathematics can be a coherent enterprise – that solving a puzzle about prime numbers or an equation of motion or a question about God’s existence are all part of the same human quest for understanding. He didn’t silo himself into narrow expertise. This breadth is something the modern world, with its fragmented disciplines, often looks back on with envy. 

Euler’s influence on later scientists was immense. Laplace, Lagrange, Legendre, Gauss – all his successors built on Euler. Often, they began where Euler left off, completing proofs he conjectured or finding rigorous justifications for his heuristic arguments. When Gauss says “the study of Euler’s works will remain the best school for the different fields of mathematics, and nothing else can replace it,” it’s a testament to Euler’s lasting pedagogical value ([Leonhard Euler: Popularizing Pi and Other Mathematical Advances in the 18th Century](https://brewminate.com/leonhard-euler-popularizing-pi-and-other-mathematical-advances-in-the-18th-century/#:~:text=greatest%20of%20the%2018th%20century,when%20completed%2C%20will%20consist%20of)). Even today, Euler’s papers repay reading; one still finds nuggets of insight and creative methods that can inspire new results. The sheer volume of his writings posed a challenge: after his death, the St. Petersburg Academy continued to publish unpublished Euler manuscripts for decades – *one paper was not published until 1862*, nearly 80 years after he died ([Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) - American Mathematical Society](https://www.ams.org/bookstore/pspdf/euler-prev.pdf#:~:text=Leonhard%20Euler%20%281707,not%20published%20till%201862%2C)). His collected works, *Opera Omnia*, fill over 80 thick volumes ([Leonhard Euler: Popularizing Pi and Other Mathematical Advances in the 18th Century](https://brewminate.com/leonhard-euler-popularizing-pi-and-other-mathematical-advances-in-the-18th-century/#:~:text=of%20us%20all.%E2%80%9D,in%C2%A0Berlin%2C%20then%20the%20capital%20of%C2%A0Prussia)). It is often quipped that reading everything Euler wrote in one lifetime would be nearly impossible – a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much. And Euler did all this while mentoring students, raising a large family, going blind, surviving wars and personal tragedies (he lost children to disease, and his house burned down in 1771), and never losing his warmth or his faith.

Perhaps the most humanizing aspect of Euler’s story is that, for all his genius, he remained modest and good-humored. He preferred a simple life, turning down offers that would take him away from his work or family. In 1773, when his beloved wife Katharina died, Euler endured with stoic faith, continuing to work (he remarried three years later, to her half-sister, to have companionship in his old age). Those around him spoke of his *“innocent cheerfulness”* and willingness to help others with calculations or explanations. He carried no airs of intellectual snobbery. This character is reflected in his writings: **clarity, simplicity, and depth** all at once. Reading Euler, one often feels, “Oh, that seems so clear and obvious” – but only because Euler has gently led you through the maze with an expert hand.

In an epitaph for Euler, the French mathematician Condorcet wrote that Euler *“calculated without apparent effort, as men breathe”* ([](https://acmsonline.org/home2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/McIntyre.pdf#:~:text=God,in%20Europe%20during%20the%20man)). Another, less-cited line from that epitaph observes that Euler *“knew how to be simple with others, because to him everything was so clear”*. It is fitting that we end our journey into Euler’s world with a reflection on that simplicity. Euler showed that profound truths can be expressed in plain language, that difficult problems can be broken down into manageable steps, and that one can be immensely intelligent yet remain profoundly humble before the vastness of knowledge. He united the quantitative and the qualitative, the scientific and the spiritual, under the common banner of *truth*. In Euler’s own words, written in 1760 as he introduced the Princess to the concept of the universe’s magnitude: *“The works of God, studied with attention, teach us that the greatest as well as the least are ruled by the same principles”* ([

Euler spent his life uncovering those principles – in equations, in orbits, in musical chords, and in the Scriptures – and he left a legacy that continues to illuminate virtually every field of science and math. Over two centuries later, we are still following Euler’s lead, still learning from him. As Laplace advised, *“Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.”* ([Leonhard Euler: Popularizing Pi and Other Mathematical Advances in the 18th Century](https://brewminate.com/leonhard-euler-popularizing-pi-and-other-mathematical-advances-in-the-18th-century/#:~:text=greatest%20of%20the%2018th%20century,when%20completed%2C%20will%20consist%20of))
