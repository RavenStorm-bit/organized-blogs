# Stories of China’s Postgraduate Entrance Exam: Patterns, Challenges, and Trends

## Introduction  
Every year, millions of Chinese students prepare for the national postgraduate entrance examination (考研, *Kaoyan*). This high-stakes exam, often dubbed a second college entrance exam, has inspired countless personal stories of both triumphant success and heart-wrenching failure. By examining user-generated posts from forums like Baidu Tieba and Xiaohongshu, we can identify common patterns in how candidates prepare, the emotional rollercoaster they experienc ([2016考研人：二战不可耻！ - 中国教育在线](https://kaoyan.eol.cn/bao_kao/jing_yan_jiao_liu/201505/t20150515_1259470.shtml#:~:text=2016%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%9A%E4%BA%8C%E6%88%98%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AF%E8%80%BB%EF%BC%81%20))enges they face, and how they cope. These firsthand accounts also reveal how the *Kaoyan* journey has evolved over the past decade – from shifts in study strategies to mounting pressure and changing attitudes. The following sections analyze these experiences and highlight differences between those who “上岸” (successfully land a spot) and those who do not, as well as how trends have changed over time.

## The Kaoyan Landscape: Rising Competition and Changing Motivations  
In recent years, *Kaoyan* has transformed into an increasingly competitive and near-universal pursuit for Chinese college graduates. The number of exam applicants more than doubled from **1.77 million in 2016 to 4.74 million in 2023**, making it as pressure-filled as the infamous college entrance exam (高考). This surge is driven by a tough job market and cultural expectations – as one education expert noted, many Chinese employers now consider a master’s degree the *minimum* req ([一边当网红一边考研，小徐的故事不是励志鸡汤那么简单 - 腾讯新闻](https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20240229A06OTW00#:~:text=%E4%B8%80%E8%BE%B9%E5%BD%93%E7%BD%91%E7%BA%A2%E4%B8%80%E8%BE%B9%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%EF%BC%8C%E5%B0%8F%E5%BE%90%E7%9A%84%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E5%8A%B1%E5%BF%97%E9%B8%A1%E6%B1%A4%E9%82%A3%E4%B9%88%E7%AE%80%E5%8D%95%20,%E8%80%8C%E5%B0%8F%E5%BE%90%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E7%9A%84%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B%E4%B9%8B%E6%89%80%E4%BB%A5%E5%80%BC%E5%BE%97%E4%B8%8A%E7%83%AD%E6%90%9C%EF%BC%8C%E5%80%BC%E5%BE%97%E8%A2%AB%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%82%B9%E8%B5%9E%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E4%BB%85%E4%BB%85%E6%98%AF%E5%9B%A0%E4%B8%BA%E8%BF%99))ushing more students to pursue graduate school. As a result, **what once was a voluntary academic aspiration has, for many, become almost a necessity or “default” pat ([小红书背后的真相：避雷朱伟的故事与考研营销号的游戏 - 搜狐](https://www.sohu.com/a/873398478_122146617#:~:text=%E6%9C%80%E8%BF%91%E5%91%A8%E6%80%9D%E6%88%90%E8%80%81%E5%B8%88%E5%9C%A8%E7%A4%BE%E4%BA%A4%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0%E4%B8%8A%E6%99%92%E5%87%BA%E4%BA%86%E5%B0%8F%E7%BA%A2%E4%B9%A6%E2%80%9C%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E5%90%8D%E5%B8%88%E7%BA%A2%E9%BB%91%E6%A6%9C%E2%80%9D%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%EF%BC%8C%20,))llege**.

However, this trend may have peaked. After reaching a record 4.74 million examinees, **the applicant pool began to shrink** – **2024 saw about 4.38 million applicant ([小红书背后的真相：避雷朱伟的故事与考研营销号的游戏 - 搜狐](https://www.sohu.com/a/873398478_122146617#:~:text=%E6%9C%80%E8%BF%91%E5%91%A8%E6%80%9D%E6%88%90%E8%80%81%E5%B8%88%E5%9C%A8%E7%A4%BE%E4%BA%A4%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0%E4%B8%8A%E6%99%92%E5%87%BA%E4%BA%86%E5%B0%8F%E7%BA%A2%E4%B9%A6%E2%80%9C%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E5%90%8D%E5%B8%88%E7%BA%A2%E9%BB%91%E6%A6%9C%E2%80%9D%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%EF%BC%8C%20,))5 dropped further to ~3.88 million**, breaking an eight-year growth streak. Several factors contribute to this recent decline: a diversifying job market (more graduates now feel work experience can trump additional degrees), the **lure of stable civil service jobs** (a record 3.4 million applied for the 2025 civil service exam), rising costs of graduate study (tuition and housing), and expanded direct admissions for top students (reducing open spots). In short, while *Kaoyan* remains extremely competitive, **students’ calculus is changing** – some are re-evaluating the payoff of a master’s and exploring alternatives.  

Despite these shifts, the emotional stakes of *Kaoyan* remain high. Failing the exam can feel devastating: *“Postgrad exam failure means not only that all the long effort was in vain, but also facing job pressure and the gaze of friends and family”*. Yet many have found that **life does not stop after one failure**, and new paths can lead to success – a perspective increasingly shared on social platforms. The following sections delve into the common journeys of *Kaoyan* candidates, from preparation to outcome, and how these narratives reflect broader changes over time.

## Preparation Strategies: Routines, Resources, and Adaptability  
**Long, disciplined hours of study** are a hallmark of almost every *Kaoyan* story. Successful candidates often describe meticulous schedules – for example, waking before 6 a.m. to secure a library seat, studying late into the night, and cycling between dorm, clas ([小红书上的考研失利者，为什么能成为“人生赢家”？_@Shuyi_经历_图片](https://www.sohu.com/a/566987723_120454746#:~:text=%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E5%A4%B1%E8%B4%A5%EF%BC%8C%E6%84%8F%E5%91%B3%E7%9D%80%E7%9A%84%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E4%BB%85%E4%BB%85%E6%98%AF%E9%95%BF%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E5%8A%AA%E5%8A%9B%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%98%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%9C%E6%B5%81%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%98%E6%9C%89%E9%87%8D%E6%96%B0%E5%B0%B1%E4%B8%9A%E7%9A%84%E5%8E%8B%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%81%E6%9D%A5%E8%87%AA%E4%BA%B2%E6%9C%8B%E5%A5%BD%E5%8F%8B%E7%9A%84%E7%9B%AE%E5%85%89%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6)) ([小红书上的考研失利者，为什么能成为“人生赢家”？_@Shuyi_经历_图片](https://www.sohu.com/a/566987723_120454746#:~:text=%E4%BD%86%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E4%BC%9A%E5%9B%A0%E4%B8%BA%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E5%A4%B1%E5%88%A9%E8%80%8C%E5%81%9C%E6%91%86%E5%90%97%EF%BC%9F))almost military consistency. It’s common to hear that *“others see me leaving the self-study room last every night”*, as one student recounted. This intense routine reflects the understanding that *Kaoyan* is a marathon of endurance. Many stories emphasize how **persistence and time management** are key: *“Stay consistent every day.

One repeat examinee admitted that **during his first attempts, he simply followed others (getting up early, cutting out video games) without a study plan or focus, resulting in disastrously low scores**. Only on his fourth try did he analyze his weaknesses and adjust his methods: he sought guidance from a successful student at his target university, revamped his schedule, and even allowed himself controlled weekend breaks (instead of unrealistically banning all enter ([Demand for China's post-grad entrance exam keeps rising - Newsworthy](https://www.newsworthy.org.au/china-post-graduate-exam-stress-2658606881.html#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20general%20difficult,minimum%20requirement%20for%20employing%20staff))void burnout. The result was a dramatic improvement – he topped his program in the subject exam. This illustrates a key pattern: **successful candidates tend to study “smart” as well as hard**, continually refining their approach, while unsuccessful ones often lament misguided efforts.

**Using appropriate study materials and platforms** is another aspect that has changed over time. In earlier years, students relied heavily on standard textbooks, past exam papers, and maybe advice from professors or alumni. Now, **online resources and communities are central**. Students frequently turn to forums and apps (Xiaohongshu, TikTok, Bilibili) for “经验贴” (experience posts) and tips from others. For instance, **on Xiaohongshu, there are countless posts sharing study schedules, subject-specific tips, and even full “daily routine” vlogs**. Some of these are genuinely helpful, though recently educators have warned about “考研营销号” – sponsored content or overhyped success stories that might mislead candidates. Still, the collaborative spirit shines through: many will **exchange notes, recommend review books, and alert each other to important news** (like changes in syllabus or the release of cut-off scores). This readily available pool of peer knowledge marks a shift from a decade ago, making today’s preparation more resource-rich but also information-saturated.

A notable evolution in preparation method is **the use of technology versus traditional practice.** One candidate with a journalism background, who ultimately failed, reflected that she *“started doing practice questions too early and mostly on the computer”* – meaning she typed answers and even copy-pasted information while studying. This led to bad habits: she didn’t fully internalize the material and never developed the hand-writing speed needed for the exam. *“In my first mock exam I couldn’t finish in time… not hand-writing was a fatal mistake,”* she admitted, noting that on a computer she could easily look up facts and felt less pressure to organize answers herself. The lesson learned was that **simulating exam conditions is crucial**. After seeing such stories, many candidates now make sure to do timed, pen-and-paper practice exams, building the muscle memory for writing essay answers quickly. In general, successful examinees balance modern tools (like online question banks or video lectures) with old-fashioned practice (writing, rote drills, etc.), whereas some who falter realize they leaned too much on one or the other.

Another common preparation pattern is **seeking out a support network or mentorship ([我们采访了十几位考研失败者，有了这篇失败“经验贴”_复习](https://www.sohu.com/a/463153622_120084547#:~:text=match%20at%20L180%20%2F%20%E5%86%99%E5%9C%A8%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E,))oups form both in person and online. In one inspiring case, an entire dormitory of four roommates prepared for *Kaoyan* together – **all 20 students from four adjacent dorms in a medical college succeeded**. They attributed this to mutual encouragement and discipline: *“If one person picked up a book, the others would put down their phones and join”*, creating a positive peer pressure to focus. They set collective rules (quiet hours if anyone was resting, group “venting” chats at day’s end to decompress) and motivated each other by alternately imagining the swee ([我们采访了十几位考研失败者，有了这篇失败“经验贴”_复习](https://www.sohu.com/a/463153622_120084547#:~:text=%E5%85%B6%E5%AE%9E%E9%99%A4%E4%BA%86%E6%88%91%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%EF%BC%8C%E8%BA%AB%E8%BE%B9%E8%BF%98%E6%9C%89%E5%9B%A0%E4%B8%BA%E8%85%B0%E6%A4%8E%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E3%80%81%E6%8A%B5%E6%8A%97%E5%8A%9B%E4%B8%8B%E9%99%8D%E7%97%85%E6%AF%92%E5%85%A5%E4%BE%B5%E7%9F%AD%E6%9A%82%E6%80%A7%E5%A4%B1%E8%81%AA%E8%80%8C%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8D%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E8%BF%9B%E5%BA%A6%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8C%E5%AD%A6%E3%80%82%E8%BA%AB%E4%BD%93%E6%98%AF%E9%9D%A9%E5%91%BD%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%AC%E9%92%B1%EF%BC%8C%E5%8A%AA%E5%8A%9B%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E5%BE%88%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E6%9B%B4%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%EF%BC%8C%E5%9C%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8C%E6%97%B6%E4%B8%80%E5%AE%9A%E8%A6%81%E7%85%A7%E9%A1%BE%E5%A5%BD%20%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%BB%E6%88%90%E6%AD%A3%E7%A1%AE%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E4%B9%A0%E6%83%AF%E5%92%8C%E9%80%82%E5%BD%93%E7%9A%84%E9%94%BB%E7%82%BC%E9%83%BD%E6%9C%89%E5%8A%A9%E4%BA%8E%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E6%95%88%E7%8E%87%E7%9A%84%E6%8F%90%E9%AB%98%E3%80%82%E5%B8%8C%E6%9C%9B%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%BB%BA%E8%AE%AE%E8%83%BD%E5%AF%B9%E4%BD%A0%E6%9C%89%E6%89%80%E5%B8%AE%E5%8A%A9%EF%BC%8C%E8%83%BD%E4%BB%A3%E6%9B%BF%E6%88%91%E5%AE%8C%E6%88%90%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%94%9F%E6%A2%A6%E3%80%82)) admission and the bitter consequences of failure in the job market. This kind of **camaraderie and shared goal** can be a powerful motivator. By contrast, those who prepare in isolation often speak of intense loneliness. Some join online groups to find “研友” (study buddies), but as we’ll see, that can be a double-edged sword if not managed well.

In summary, **successful *Kaoyan* preparation typically involves**: a well-structured study plan, adaptation and learning from setbacks, effective use of resources (past exams, mentors, study groups), and balancing intensity with sustainability. **Unsuccessful stories often reveal lack of direction, over-reliance on brute force memorization, or not accounting for practical exam skills**. As one student who just missed the cut put it, *“I was immersing myself in hard work and self-congratulation, without checking if my direction and methods were right”*.

## Emotional Journeys: Motivation, Doubt, and Perseverance  
Preparing for *Kaoyan* is not only an academic undertaking but an emotional journey. **Motivations at the start** vary – some students are driven by pure academic passion or the dream of a spec ([终于可以说话了，天天签到我容易嘛！2014，值得期待！〖考研吧〗_百度贴吧](https://tieba.baidu.com/p/1959433098#:~:text=%E5%93%88%E5%93%88%EF%BC%8C14%E7%A0%94%EF%BC%8C%E8%A1%A8%E8%A1%A8%E5%86%B3%E5%BF%83%E3%80%82%20%E5%90%8C%E6%97%B6%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E5%BF%83%E8%B7%AF%E5%8E%86%E7%A8%8B%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E6%B1%82%E5%B0%BD%E5%96%84%E5%B0%BD%E7%BE%8E%EF%BC%8C%E9%9D%A2%E9%9D%A2%E4%BF%B1%E5%88%B0%EF%BC%9B%E5%8F%AA%E4%BC%9A%E7%9C%9F%E5%AE%9E%E9%81%93%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%8B%89%E5%8A%B1%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%80%E6%AD%A5%E6%AD%A5%E6%88%90%E9%95%BF%E3%80%82%E7%BB%99%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E4%B8%80%E4%BB%BD%E9%9A%BE%E5%BF%98%E5%9B%9E%E5%BF%86%EF%BC%8C%E4%B9%9F%E5%B8%8C%E6%9C%9B%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%B6%E5%A4%9A%E5%A4%9A%E9%BC%93%E5%8A%B1%E6%8C%87%E5%AF%BC)) ([终于可以说话了，天天签到我容易嘛！2014，值得期待！〖考研吧〗_百度贴吧](https://tieba.baidu.com/p/1959433098#:~:text=%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E9%97%AE%E6%88%91%EF%BC%8C%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E6%80%8E%E9%BA%BD%E6%A0%B7%E4%BA%86%EF%BC%9F%E6%84%9F%E8%A7%89%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%EF%BC%9F%E6%88%91%E6%98%AF%E7%9C%9F%E4%B8%8D%E5%A5%BD%E6%84%8F%E6%80%9D%E8%AF%B4%E5%87%BA%E5%8F%A3%EF%BC%8C%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E8%BF%98%E5%9C%A8%E8%B5%B7%E6%AD%A5%E5%BE%98%E5%BE%8A%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E7%9F%A5%E4%B9%9F%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5%E6%80%A7%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92%E3%80%82%E6%AF%8F%E6%AF%8F%E7%9C%8B%E5%88%B0%E5%8A%AA%E5%8A%9B%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8C%E5%AD%A6%E6%80%BB%E4%BC%9A%E6%8F%90%E9%86%92%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E8%AF%A5%E5%8A%AA%E5%8A%9B%E4%BA%86%EF%BC%8C%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E4%B8%8D%E6%97%A9%E4%BA%86%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AF%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%E5%9D%9A%E6%8C%81%20%E4%B8%8D%E4%BA%86%E5%A4%9A%E9%95%BF%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E3%80%82%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%A8%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%AA%E5%AD%A6%E6%9C%9F%E4%B9%9F%E5%B0%86%E7%BB%93%E6%9D%9F%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%9F%E6%9C%AB%E5%B0%86%E8%87%B3%EF%BC%8C%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E5%8C%86%E5%8C%86%E5%8D%B4%E5%8F%88%E5%9C%A8%E6%9F%90%E4%B8%AA%E4%B8%8D%E7%BB%8F%E6%84%8F%E7%9A%84%E7%9E%AC%E9%97%B4%E6%8A%BD%E4%BD%A0%E4%B8%80%E9%9E%AD%EF%BC%8C%E7%81%AB%E8%BE%A3%E8%BE%A3%E5%9C%A8%E5%BF%83%E9%87%8C%E3%80%82%E5%BF%83%E6%83%85%E4%BD%8E%E6%B2%89%EF%BC%8C%EF%BC%8C%EF%BC%8C%EF%BC%8C%EF%BC%8C%EF%BC%8C%E8%A6%81%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%EF%BC%8C%E5%8D%B4%E6%B2%A1%E6%84%9F%E8%A7%89%E5%88%B0%E8%B6%B3%E5%A4%9F%E7%9A%84%E5%8A%A8%E5%8A%9B))s by more pragmatic reasons like esca ([我们采访了十几位考研失败者，有了这篇失败“经验贴”_复习](https://www.sohu.com/a/463153622_120084547#:~:text=%E7%9B%B8%E4%BF%A1%E5%BE%88%E5%A4%9A%E5%B0%8F%E4%BC%99%E4%BC%B4%E5%9C%A8%E5%88%9A%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E6%97%B6%EF%BC%8C%E9%83%BD%E4%BC%9A%E6%89%93%E5%BC%80%E7%BD%91%E9%A1%B5%EF%BC%8C%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2%E2%80%9C%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C%E8%B4%B4%E2%80%9D%E4%B8%89%E4%B8%AA%E5%AD%97%EF%BC%8C%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%9B%E8%B7%A8%E8%80%83%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E3%80%81%E4%B8%89%E4%B8%AA%E6%9C%88%E9%80%86%E8%A2%AD%E7%9A%84%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C%E8%B4%B4%E7%8A%B9%E5%A6%82%E6%AD%A6%E5%8A%9F%E7%A7%98%E7%B1%8D%EF%BC%8C%E8%AE%A9%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E6%AC%B2%E7%BD%A2%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%BF%E4%BD%9B%E5%8F%AA%E8%A6%81%E8%AE%A4%E7%9C%9F%E6%8F%90%E5%8F%96%E5%85%B6%E4%B8%AD%E7%B2%BE%E9%AB%93%20%EF%BC%8C%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E5%B0%B1%E8%83%BD%E6%B7%B1%E5%BE%97%E7%9C%9F%E4%BC%A0%E4%B8%80%E8%B7%AF%E5%BC%80%E6%8C%82%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E3%80%82)) ([我们采访了十几位考研失败者，有了这篇失败“经验贴”_复习](https://www.sohu.com/a/463153622_120084547#:~:text=%E5%85%B6%E5%AE%9E%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E5%8F%97%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8D%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%BF%83%E6%83%85%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%8E%E9%82%A3%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E5%87%A0%E4%B9%8E%E6%94%BE%E5%BC%83%E4%BA%86%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%89%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%E8%BF%9E%E7%9D%80%E4%B8%A4%E4%B8%89%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%80%E7%82%B9%E9%83%BD%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%A4%8D%E4%B9%A0%E3%80%82)) ([我们采访了十几位考研失败者，有了这篇失败“经验贴”_复习](https://www.sohu.com/a/463153622_120084547#:~:text=%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E5%B0%8F%E7%99%BD))ietal expectations.

One 26-y ([Demand for China's post-grad entrance exam keeps rising - Newsworthy](https://www.newsworthy.org.au/china-post-graduate-exam-stress-2658606881.html#:~:text=higher,to%20China%27s%20Ministry%20of%20Education)) ([Shrinking graduate applications reflect a market shift - Opinion - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202412/17/WS6760b523a310f1265a1d3326.html#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20China%20has,from%20that%20two%20years%20ago)) exam twice, confessed, *“I just feel the Master’s degree can give me more options,”* even though he struggled to articulate why he was so obsessed. For many, it is seen as a “ticket” to bigger cities or better careers. For example, a graduate recounted deciding to take *Kaoyan* primarily to avoid having to return to his small hometown – staying in Beijing meant everything to him. Such pragmatic motivation has grown stronger over time as the job market tightened. In contrast, a decade ago you might more often hear students emphasize love of research or personal fulfillment; those sentiments still exist, but practical considerations now loom larger in the decision to attempt *Kaoyan*.

Once study begins in earnest, **candidates often ride a wave of early optimism that gradually meets reality.** In the initial months, many feel determined: they set grand goals and publicly declare their commitment. (One Tieba user in 2012 started a thread titled *“2014, Worth Expecting!”* to record his daily progress and spur himself on.) However, as the months drag on, monotony and self-doubt creep in. It’s common to hit a “wall” midway through preparation. **Feelings of inadequacy and anxiety frequently surface around summer**: *“I see classmates working so hard, it reminds me I should too… but I just can’t sustain it for long,”* the same Tieba user admitted candidly, chiding himself for procrastinating. Many describe the **loneliness of the process** – studying while others socialize or relax – and the mental toll of constant comparison. *“Memorize and forget, forget and memorize, I’ve lost count how many times I’ve questioned my life,”* one Xiaohongshu blogger wrote, capturing the frustration of seemingly endless review cycles.

As the exam draws near (the final few weeks or “冲刺” phase), **stress and nerves peak**. It’s not unusual to hear of insomnia, panic attacks, or a sense of desperation (“*I wished I could handcuff myself to the famed teacher’s side*,” one person joked about clinging to a popular exam guru during the last stretch). In some success stories, this crucible produces an almost euphoric determination – candidates double down and push through, surprising even themselves. In other cases, unfortunately, candidates **hit a breaking point** and burn out or give up before the exam. One contributor described September (just months before the test) as the time her journey effectively ended: suffering health issues and discouragement, she “stopped” while everyone else was sprinting, and essentially abandoned studying with weeks to go. *“Compared to others who fail in the moment they see their scores, my failure was decided by September,”* she wrote, reflecting a deep sense of inevitability once her morale collapsed.

Throughout the emotional journey, **external support and pressures play a role**. Family can be a source of encouragement or stress (or both). Older stories suggest that parents were sometimes less understanding of a failure, perhaps seeing it as lost face or wasted effort. But more recent narratives show families becoming more supportive of multiple attempts or alternative plans – for example, some parents now accompany students to exam locales or even prepare alongside them (one much-shared story from 2020 told of a mother who studied with her daughter and they *both* passed the exam, inspiring many). Peer support, as mentioned, is crucial: having a friend or group going through the same thing can normalize the ups and downs, whereas studying in isolation can amplify doubts. On the flip side, hearing about others’ progress can also heighten anxiety. One student recounts how joining a WeChat group of fellow *Kaoyan* aspirants turned toxic for her mindset: **she would compare her progress to others and listen to every piece of advice (often horror stories of failure), which fed her anxiety**. *“It’s not that you can’t listen to people who failed, but you can’t completely believe everything,”* she realized later, noting that she let others’ pessimism shake her confidence. The healthiest approach, as she and others learned, is to filter external voices – take in useful tips but avoid internalizing others’ stress. *“We hear so many voices on the road to *Kaoyan*, but ultimately only our own outcome matters… we must stay calm and true to our plan,”* an article concluded, summing up this balance.

**Perseverance** is the emotional quality that most often separates those who eventually succeed from those who don’t. Virtually every success story contains a moment (or many) of doubt where quitting felt tempting. What changes the trajectory is how the person responds. Some describe **a turning point where despair turned into renewed resolve** – perhaps triggered by a mentor’s encouragement, a modest improvement in mock exam scores, or even the fear of regret. In one case, a student who had failed once and was working a job decided to attempt the exam again; her turning point was realizing she couldn’t forgive herself if she didn’t “give it one more genuine shot.” She slowed down, **focused on fixing past mistakes instead of wallowing in them**, and treated the second attempt as a fresh start. The result: she passed on her second try with a much higher score, crediting the emotional reset and lessons from failure for the outcome. By contrast, those who do not make it often describe a sense of being overwhelmed by negative emotions that ultimately derailed their preparation (like the story of “无糖” who effectively ceased studying due to health anxiety and hopelessness). 

It’s worth noting that **attitudes toward *Kaoyan* failure have been slowly shifting**. Traditionally, failing *Kaoyan* (especially if one attempted it full-time after college) was seen as a severe personal setback – some would use terms like “人生黑暗的一年” (“a dark year of my life”). Feelings of shame and self-blame were common, with some saying *“I felt I’d let myself down”* more than anything. In recent years, thanks in part to the openness of social media, more candidates are sharing their failure stories without shame and even finding silver linings. It’s not unusual now to see posts that say, *“I failed *Kaoyan*, but that’s okay – here’s what I learned and what I’m doing next.”* This doesn’t eliminate the disappointment, but it shows a healthier emotional recovery. As we explore next, some who fail ultimately find success in other avenues, and their emotional journey transforms into one of resilience and growth rather than permanent defeat.

## Key Challenges and Coping Mechanisms  
Preparing for *Kaoyan* comes with a host of **challenges – academic, psychological, and physical.** Academically, the scope of the exam is daunting: multiple subjects (generally politics, English, and two subject-specific tests) each demanding thorough preparation. **Information overload** is a real hurdle – as one student quipped, *“背了忘，忘了背”* (“memorize then forget, then forget what I memorized”) in an endless loop. Keeping vast amounts of content fresh in memory is hard work. Successful candidates often cope by **making concise notes, summaries, or structured mind maps** to condense the material. In contrast, those who flounder sometimes realize they spent too long passively rereading or brute-memorizing without techniques to retain information. One common regret from failed attempts is *“I thought just reading and highlighting was enough – I should have done more active recall and practice.”* To avoid this, many have started using flashcards or teaching the material to imaginary students as a way to reinforce learning. **Adapting study technique to the exam’s demands** (e.g. practicing writing essays by hand, as noted earlier) is another challenge candidates must recognize and address to succeed.

**Time management** and pacing present another challenge. The exam is usually in late December, so students often start as early as the previous spring or even earlier. Maintaining productivity over 9+ months is difficult. Burnout is a frequent adversary – some students peak too early (studying intensively in spring and then losing steam by fall), whereas others procrastinate and then scramble in the last months. Both patterns appear in failure stories. A student nicknamed “向日葵” admitted she jumped into heavy problem-solving practice in the spring, skipping foundational study; by the time she realized her mistake, it was late and her basics were weak. On the flip side, an anonymous poster described how he wasted the summer due to a personal crisis (a relationship breakup) and fell into *“the darkest, most depressed month”*, emerging in fall with far less time – his scores suffered accordingly (a cautionary tale that **emotional setbacks can steal precious time** if not managed). Successful candidates often cope by building **flexibility into their schedule** – they set targets but also account for breaks and potential setbacks, adjusting as needed. They treat *Kaoyan* prep as a job: full-time, with a routine, but also with *Sundays off* or some evenings free to recharge, which paradoxically helps them go the distance.

A major challenge that emerges in many stories is **psychological pressure and mental health**. The fear of failure itself can be paralyzing. Some describe being haunted by the question “What if I don’t pass?” throughout the year, which can sap confidence. Coping mechanisms here vary. Many turn to **peer support or online communities** for reassurance – reading success stories to stay inspired or failure stories to feel “not alone” and learn vicariously. Indeed, as one article noted, *“studying others’ success is useful, but sometimes lessons from failure help us avoid traps and detours”*. That sentiment has led to an abundance of “失败经验帖” (failure experience posts) where people dissect why they failed so others can benefit. This trend itself is a coping mechanism: the community is collectively trying to prevent repeat mistakes by openly discussing them. For instance, **common pitfalls identified include**: neglecting one’s health, poor planning, sticking blindly to one source or method, and letting discouragement fester. By circulating these cautionary tales, candidates cope with the pressure by feeling more prepared and aware.

Speaking of health, **physical health issues** are an often underreported but significant challenge. The sedentary, high-stress lifestyle of *Kaoyan* prep can lead to ailments – and indeed user stories confirm this. *“身体是革命的本钱”* (the body is the capital of the revolution) became a rallying cry after tales like that of “无糖”, who developed a severe cervical spine problem from long hours of hunched studying. She ignored dizziness and nausea for weeks, afraid to lose study time by seeking proper treatment, which only worsened her condition. Eventually, doctors warned her that if she didn’t reduce studying, she wouldn’t physically be able to sit through the exam. This forced her to almost abandon her attempt, and indeed she couldn’t perform well. She later discovered peers who suffered **slipped discs, weakened immunity leading to temporary hearing loss**, and other maladies from overstraining. The clear lesson: **neglecting health can derail the entire effort**. Now, more candidates are aware of this and incorporate basic self-care into their routine (short exercise breaks, ergonomic study setups, etc.). Still, it’s a challenge to convince oneself to pause studying for health’s sake – many only learn after experiencing a scare. Successful candidates often note that staying healthy (physically and mentally) was *as important* as studying hard, enabling them to actually make it to exam day in good shape.

How do students cope with these myriad challenges? **Developing personal coping mechanisms is crucial**. Some of the most common include: 

- **Peer Support and “Venting”**: Forming study alliances or just having friends to rant to. We saw how the medical dorm group held nightly “吐槽大会” (complaint sessions) where they deliberately talked about anything *but* the exam to lighten the mood. This prevented bottling up stress. Similarly, many students use online forums (like Tieba threads or Weibo) almost as diaries to express feelings anonymously and receive encouragement. Knowing that *“you’re not the only one struggling”* offers great solace.

- **Inspirational Content and Visioning**: It’s common for students to stick motivational quotes on their walls or follow motivational bloggers. Some imagine the moment of success – e.g. **picturing the grad school admission letter or even using the fear of failure as fuel**. In the dorm story, when someone felt like slacking, the roommates would *“talk about how hard finding a job would be if we fail, or paint the picture of how happy life will be after we pass”* – both negative and positive imagery to push each other. This mental technique of keeping the “why” in mind helps many persevere.

- **Scheduled Breaks and Rewards**: Avoiding burnout is key, so many adopt the strategy of giving themselves small rewards. For instance, one previously unsuccessful candidate realized forbidding himself from video games entirely only backfired (he ended up binge-playing out of frustration). On his next attempt, he allowed *“weekday no games, weekend can play”* as a reward system, which helped him stay focused during the week without feeling utterly deprived. Others treat themselves to a nice meal, a movie, or a day off after finishing a milestone (like completing a syllabus or scoring a certain mark in a mock test). These tactics keep morale up over the long haul.

- **Seeking Guidance**: Coping also means not struggling alone when stuck. Successful candidates are often those who reached out for help – whether hiring a tutor, consulting alumni of the target program, or simply asking professors for advice on the research proposal. One story mentioned how a student paid a mediator to connect with a grad student from his dream school; that grad student’s tips on focusing on past exam patterns gave him a clear direction he lacked before. It was a turning point in his preparation. This willingness to seek mentorship or better information is a coping response to the challenge of uncertainty (“am I studying the right way?”).

- **Plan B Mindset**: Interestingly, some cope with *Kaoyan* pressure by mentally preparing a fallback plan. Knowing that *“if I don’t pass, I will do X”* can relieve the all-or-nothing stress. A number of posts in recent years discuss alternatives like *“If I fail, I’ll go abroad for a master’s”* or *“I’ll take the civil service exam / pursue a job and maybe try again later.”* This doesn’t mean they are less committed to *Kaoyan*, but having a safety net can stabilize one’s mindset. It appears that candidates are now more open to these alternative paths (whereas in the past, not getting into grad school immediately might have felt like the end of the world). We even see success stories where Plan B became a new success: for example, a Xiaohongshu user failed *Kaoyan* twice, then worked for five years and eventually earned a master’s admission in Germany – a path that turned her initial failure into a different kind of achievement. Knowing such examples exist can help current students realize a single exam doesn’t define their entire future, thus reducing panic and giving a sense of control.

In summary, **the challenges of *Kaoyan*** range from managing an immense workload and staying healthy to overcoming self-doubt and external pressure. **Coping mechanisms** have become more openly discussed and varied, including communal support, mental resilience techniques, strategic breaks, and contingency planning. The candidates who ultimately prevail are not necessarily those who had an easy ride, but those who confronted these challenges head-on and found ways to adapt. As one article aptly noted, *“酸甜苦辣都得样样尝过”* (“you have to taste all the sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy”) – there are no shortcuts, but each challenge can teach a lesson and build strength.

## Turning Points and Outcomes: Success vs. Failure Narratives  
While every individual’s journey is unique, the collected stories reveal **certain turning points** that commonly influence the final outcome of *Kaoyan*. By examining these inflection points, we can distinguish patterns in successful vs. unsuccessful experiences.

For many who succeed, a critical turning point is **an episode of failure or setback that they actively learn from.** It may sound paradoxical, but initial failure often sows the seeds for later success. A case in point is blogger @HME on Xiaohongshu: after failing her first attempt, she dissected what went wrong and adjusted her entire approach. She realized she needed to *“start reviewing public courses earlier, deeply analyze past exam questions, choose the right prep class, and allocate tasks precisely”*, among other changes. With these corrections, she succeeded on her second try, gaining admission to Nanjing University. Her story highlights that **what one does after failing (reflecting, tweaking strategy) can make or break the next attempt**. Successful candidates often echo this theme: rather than seeing failure as the end, they treat it as feedback. They identify specific weaknesses – be it poor English vocabulary, weak math fundamentals, or bad time management – and address them before the next round. In contrast, those who fail repeatedly without improvement sometimes fall into the trap of *“doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result.”* Several “三战” (third-time) or even “四战” examinees admitted that for a long time they kept studying in the exact same way despite previous underperformance, only to get the same disappointing outcome. **The turning point for eventual success often comes when the person breaks that cycle through a new strategy or mindset.**

Another turning point is **the moment of deciding on one’s target and whether to adjust it.** Choosing which university and program to aim for is a pivotal early decision. Some failures trace back to an overly ambitious target without a backup plan. For example, blogger @水果馅的汤圆 (whose handle means “rice-dumpling with fruit filling”) recounted her *four-year* struggle chasing one dream school (Renmin University). In the first year, after not getting in, she *refused to accept offers from other decent universities via调剂 (reassignment) because she was fixated on her top choice*. She then spent three more years trying, and still fell short. In hindsight she called it “a detour” – implying regret that she didn’t seize the opportunity at a slightly less prestigious school and save herself years of effort. On the other hand, some successful stories involve strategic flexibility: candidates who adjusted their goals based on their mock scores or changing interests. One student described how he initially aimed for a highly competitive program but, after scoring around the national cutoff in a mock exam, **he pivoted to a safer choice and got admitted there**. His turning point was accepting a realistic match for his level, rather than risking total failure for a dream. Over time, the stigma of choosing a “lower” university has lessened as more people prioritize simply getting into *some* graduate program (given the large numbers who get shut out entirely). Thus, **a key difference is that successful candidates either choose appropriate targets from the start or are willing to recalibrate, whereas unsuccessful ones may stubbornly lock onto a goal beyond their reach without Plan B**.

The **final exam performance** itself can be a turning point in narratives – sometimes in unpredictable ways. Anecdotes abound of exam-day surprises: unexpected easy or hard questions, emotional swings during the test, or external circumstances. An almost tragic story shared on a social app illustrates how fate can intervene: A user wrote, *“It feels like God is teasing me – I failed my second try at *Kaoyan*. The year I scored my highest, the program suddenly cut 20 seats. If it were a year earlier or later, I would have made it… Everything’s over, maybe I’m just not fated for 985 (top university) life.”*. This poignant account shows an outcome hinging not on the student’s effort (which was actually successful by prior standards) but on external factors (a reduction in admissions that year). Such stories of near-miss due to bad luck underscore that **not all failures are equal** – some are a matter of chance or timing. Successful students rarely have to mention luck, but those who fail sometimes attribute it to these uncontrollable events. Over the years, awareness of the competitive fluctuation (for instance, cut-off scores rising unpredictably, or certain majors shrinking intake) has grown. To cope, many candidates now apply to multiple programs (when possible) or at least keep an eye on trends to avoid being blindsided. The difference can be seen as **successful candidates mitigate risk where they can**, while others unfortunately pin all hopes on a single outcome that may be subject to luck. (It’s worth noting, however, that perseverance can turn luck around – the same student above might succeed if she tries again when seats expand, and indeed some who missed by a hair’s breadth do make it on subsequent attempts.)

In the aftermath, **the narratives of success and failure diverge sharply in tone and lessons.** Those who succeed often describe a feeling of *“finally worth it”* – a validation of all their hardship. They frequently express gratitude: to supportive friends, family, or even their past self for not giving up. It’s common to read lines like *“I couldn’t have done it without [X]”* or *“this taught me the power of persistence.”* Many successful candidates also show humility, acknowledging that others who worked just as hard didn’t make it, and thus they don’t take it for granted. On social media, newly admitted students will share tips for the next cohort, almost as a way of “paying forward” the wisdom. For instance, a Tsinghua admit who got in after three tries (handle @Shuyi学姐) became a minor Xiaohongshu celebrity by sharing detailed advice on how she improved each year – from refining her English essay writing to networking with professors. Such individuals become beacons for future examinees, proving that even a non-elite undergrad can *逆袭* (counterattack) into a top program with enough determination.

Those who fail, on the other hand, narrate a journey that can end in despair, redirection, or occasionally, liberation. Immediately after results, many describe an emotional low point: *“seeing my score, I felt the world collapse”* is a typical sentiment. Feelings of self-doubt peak: one blogger who failed multiple times confessed she started wondering if she was just not smart enough, saying *“Things that are so easy for others turn out so hard for me”*. However, the trajectory after failure varies. Some do decide to “二战” (fight a second time) or even more, essentially resetting their journey with lessons learned. Others reach a **turning point of acceptance**, deciding that perhaps academia isn’t their path. Increasingly, we see failure stories morph into **different kinds of success stories**. For example, a Sohu article highlighted *“Xiaohongshu’s *Kaoyan* failures who became life winners”*. It profiled people like @SHIRUI爱尔兰 who failed *Kaoyan* twice but then built a career and later secured a foreign graduate offer, or another who channeled her energies into a job and personal growth, eventually feeling happier than she might have been in grad school. Their message: *Kaoyan* failure was not the end, but a redirection to a path where they still achieved their goals by other means. 

That said, not every failure story wraps up so neatly. There are also cautionary tales of those stuck in limbo – having spent years on *Kaoyan* with nothing to show, struggling with the sense of lost time. Mental health professionals in China have noted a rise in *Kaoyan*-related depression or anxiety disorders, especially for those who isolate themselves for years preparing. This has prompted calls for students to set a limit (perhaps two attempts) to avoid falling into a perpetual cycle. It appears that conversation around this is becoming more open, with people sharing experiences of moving on and encouraging others to not lose themselves entirely in the process.

In comparing **successful vs. unsuccessful candidates**, several **key differences** emerge:

- **Planning and Strategy**: Successful students tend to have a clear study plan and adjust it when it’s not working. Unsuccessful ones often either lack a plan or stick to an ineffective one without realizing. As one person reflected after failing by one point, *“I was immersed in being busy but didn’t verify if my method was right”*. Successful candidates focus on understanding and application (especially in open-ended subjects), whereas some unsuccessful candidates admit they relied too much on rote memorization or brute force, which didn’t pay off.

- **Adaptability**: Those who succeed show flexibility – if health issues arise, they recalibrate; if they realize a study technique isn’t fruitful, they try a different approach. Those who fail sometimes are derailed by a single problem. For instance, “无糖” unfortunately could not adapt once her health crisis hit and essentially had to forfeit. In contrast, a successful peer might have taken a short break, recovered, and resumed with a modified schedule. Adaptability also applies to goals – successful folks may settle for a plan B grad school (and later find it was still worthwhile), whereas the unwillingness to compromise can leave others empty-handed.

- **Use of Support**: Successful candidates often lean on support networks in a constructive way – forming study groups like the 100% success dorm, or seeking mentors. They avoid toxic comparisons and know when to tune out unhelpful advice. Unsuccessful ones might either isolate completely (missing out on potential help) or, conversely, become overwhelmed by others’ input (as in the WeChat group anxiety case). Striking the right balance in using peer support is an art that the successful seem to manage better.

- **Mindset and Resilience**: Perhaps the most important difference is psychological. Successful candidates are not free of anxiety or doubt, but they possess resilience – the ability to bounce back from setbacks, maintain self-belief, and persist to the end. They often actively combat negative thoughts, reminding themselves of their initial motivation or envisioning the finish line. Unsuccessful candidates, especially those who give up, often describe being consumed by negativity or losing sight of why they started. It’s telling that many success stories contain a phrase like “坚持就是胜利” (“perseverance is victory”), reflecting the ethos that sticking it out is half the battle. Those who quit or collapse under pressure unfortunately don’t get to see that victory.

- **Outcome Management**: Even in the outcome phase, there’s a difference. Successful candidates, after passing, continue to plan (preparing for interviews, etc.), while those who failed face a choice: wallow or pivot. The “pivoters” – who quickly turn their focus to a job hunt, another exam, or a new goal – often end up narrating a more positive long-term story than those who stagnate. The speed and proactivity of response after failure is a distinguishing factor. For example, one girl who failed and felt utterly lost decided within a month to apply for an overseas program and channeled her energy there; a year later she was happily studying abroad, effectively salvaging her career plans. Another who failed might spend that year in limbo, unsure what to do next. **Thus, what one does after the results (either result) is critical**. Over time, more resources (career fairs, counseling) have become available to help those who don’t pass *Kaoyan*, which may be contributing to the healthier narratives of recent failures turning into different successes.

In conclusion of this section, the turning points in *Kaoyan* stories – be it a moment of clarity during prep, a decision to change strategy, or the outcome and response to it – illuminate why some succeed and others fail. The **successful journeys are marked by timely course-corrections, resilience in the face of setbacks, and often a bit of good fortune or smart decision-making**. The **unsuccessful journeys often feature critical misjudgments (unrealistic goals, poor methods) or uncontrollable mishaps that weren’t mitigated**. Crucially, success is not solely defined by passing the exam – as many stories now show, there are “成功” (successes) to be found even after *Kaoyan* failure, in the form of new opportunities seized by those with the courage to find them.

## Evolving Trends Over Time  
The *Kaoyan* experience today is both the same and not the same as it was for students a decade or two ago. **Core elements – hard work, stress, the joy of success and pain of failure – remain constant**. But several trends in these stories reflect broader changes in Chinese society and the education system over the years:

- **Mounting Pressure and “卷” Culture:** Perhaps the most striking change is the sheer scale of competition. A decade ago, *Kaoyan* was intense but the odds were less daunting; now it’s common knowledge that only about 1 in 4 will get a spot, and in popular majors at top schools, only a tiny fraction make it. This has given rise to the sentiment that everyone must “内卷” (involute, i.e. engage in hyper-competition). Stories from the late 2010s onward frequently mention feeling part of a “考研大军” (exam army) and use war-like metaphors. The exam is no longer just an academic pursuit but a high-stakes battle affecting one’s career trajectory in a saturated graduate market. As one news piece reported, *“once, a score of 380 was solid for admission; now even candidates with 400+ are being turned away at top programs”*. This ratcheting up of standards is felt in the tone of recent experiences – there is often less room for error, making the process more unforgiving. The drop in applicant numbers in 2024 and 2025 suggests that this pressure may have reached a breaking point, prompting some to opt out or choose alternatives. It will be interesting to see if the narratives in coming years reflect a slight relief as competition eases, or if the intensity remains but among a self-selected group of die-hards.

- **Multiple Attempts Normalized:** In earlier years, doing## Evolving Trends Over Time (continued)  
- **Multiple Attempts and “Gap Years” Normalized:** Years ago, it was more typical to take *Kaoyan* in one’s final year of college and, if unsuccessful, move on to a job. Now, it’s increasingly common to see second-try (*二战*) or even third-try candidates who dedicate extra years solely to exam prep. The stigma around retaking has lessened – forums are full of “二战群” (second-attempt groups) where repeat examinees support each other, and motivational slogans like *“二战不可耻”* (“a second battle isn’t shameful”) circulate. These repeaters often share their experiences candidly, creating a body of knowledge on how to bounce back after failure. The downside is that some get caught in a cycle of retakes, which can be emotionally and financially taxing. Nonetheless, the **perception of taking time to try again has become more accepted**, reflecting a shift in mindset: *Kaoyan* is now seen as a long game for many, not a one-and-done shot.

- **Social Media Influence – A Double-Edged Sword:** The rise of platforms like Xiaohongshu, Weibo, and Bilibili over the past 5-10 years has profoundly changed how *Kaoyan* experiences are shared. On one hand, **there’s more peer-to-peer guidance and solidarity than ever before.** Students post daily study logs, tips, and even emotional check-ins, amassing followers who cheer them on. Viral success stories (for example, a “study influencer” with millions of views who passed *Kaoyan* while live-streaming her study sessions) can inspire others to work harder. On the other hand, the **line between genuine sharing and commercial content has blurred**. Some “考研励志故事” on Xiaohongshu were revealed to be marketing ploys by tutoring companies – polished tales designed to sell courses or books. Educators like Zhu Wei publicly cautioned students to “避雷” (steer clear) of certain *Kaoyan* bloggers who overhype results. Thus, while social media provides community, it also requires discernment. Students now must navigate an information ecosystem where not every “success formula” is trustworthy. Overall, though, the openness of the internet has made *Kaoyan* preparation less of a lonely, secretive endeavor and more of a shared journey for this generation.

- **Shifting Attitudes Toward Failure and Alternatives:** Another notable change is how failure is framed. **More people today emphasize that failing *Kaoyan* is not a personal failure at life.** As discussed, many who failed have gone online to share how they rebuilt their path – by working, going abroad, or trying again. These narratives chip away at the old notion that one must either get into grad school or be deemed “not good enough.” In fact, some *Kaoyan* “failures” are now celebrated for their courage to forge a different route. The question *“If you don’t get in, what’s next?”* is openly addressed, whereas in the past it might be avoided out of embarrassment. Furthermore, **the motivations for taking *Kaoyan* have broadened**. It’s no longer pursued only by those wanting an academic career; many treat it as a way to postpone entering a tough job market, or to pivot fields (since the exam allows “跨考”, changing majors). Consequently, failing the exam might simply redirect someone to start their career sooner – which some later recognize was actually a better fit for them. Societal pressure is slowly easing on this front, as seen in articles and posts that encourage students to view *Kaoyan* as one of many opportunities, not a do-or-die verdict.

- **Exam Policy and Systemic Changes:** The *Kaoyan* system itself has evolved over time, affecting personal stories. For instance, **the expansion of “推免” (recommendation-based admission)** means top undergraduates can skip the exam and go directly to grad school. This has reduced the available spots in some programs, inadvertently raising the bar for exam takers. Some exam-takers have felt frustrated competing with what they perceive as fewer opportunities, and some failure stories cite losing out to “push admits.” Additionally, the **content of exams has been reformed in certain fields**. As noted earlier, subjects like journalism and communications have moved away from pure memorization to more application-based questions. This means that study strategies have had to adapt – those who recognized the need to build analytical skills (not just memorize textbooks) fared better. The influence of these reforms appears in stories where students talk about doing internships or following current events to prepare for the application of theory, which was less mentioned a decade ago. Lastly, the **COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022)** left an imprint: it temporarily boosted *Kaoyan* numbers (due to a weak job market and overseas study barriers), and it forced many students to prepare under lockdown conditions. Some 2021–2022 diaries mention being stuck at home or campus for months, which cut distractions (helping some study more) but also heightened anxiety for others. Pandemic-era experiences varied, but they reinforced the idea that adaptability is key – one student described how she switched to online study resources and maintained a routine even in quarantine, turning a potential disruption into an advantage. With the pandemic receding, its effects on *Kaoyan* stories are fading, but that period exemplified how external events can suddenly alter the *Kaoyan* journey for a whole cohort.

In sum, **the narrative of *Kaoyan* has grown more complex over time**. The stakes became higher as competition intensified, yet at the same time, there’s a more nuanced understanding that this exam is not the sole arbiter of one’s worth. Community support is more readily available (albeit with the need to filter signal from noise), and students are arming themselves with more information than ever before. The emotional tone has also matured: where once a failed *Kaoyan* might be met with silence or stigma, now it’s often met with communal empathy and stories of Plan B. The system’s changes – more applicants earlier, then a recent dip, policy tweaks, etc. – all color the backdrop against which these personal stories unfold.

## Conclusion  
The collective stories of *Kaoyan* success and failure in China paint a vivid picture of perseverance, heartache, adaptation, and hope. From the bleary-eyed dawn study sessions to the tension-filled wait for results, *Kaoyan* is as much a test of character as of knowledge. **Common threads run through these tales**: nearly all aspirants struggle with finding effective study methods, battling self-doubt, and sustaining motivation through isolation. Those who eventually succeed often do so through a combination of disciplined planning, willingness to learn from setbacks, emotional resilience, and sometimes strategic recalibration of their goals. Those who do not succeed frequently offer invaluable lessons in what pitfalls to avoid – be it neglecting one’s health, refusing to adjust strategy, or succumbing to outside pressure and panic.

Importantly, **the meaning of success and failure in the *Kaoyan* context has evolved**. Achieving a coveted admission (“上岸”) remains a euphoric triumph that can open doors; yet, failing the exam is increasingly seen not as a dead end but as an experience to grow from or redirect to new opportunities. As one commentary noted, *“Success stories are worthy of praise, but the experiences of failures are also worth our contemplation”*. Together, they provide a 360-degree understanding of the postgraduate exam journey. Over the past decade, rising competition and social media have made the process more intense and more public, but they have also fostered a stronger sense of community and dialogue around mental health and alternative paths.

For future *Kaoyan* candidates, these shared stories offer a treasure trove of insights. **Key takeaways include**: build a solid foundation before chasing advanced problems; simulate exam conditions in practice; take care of your physical and mental health (“健康更重要” as many warn); seek advice but filter it to suit your situation; and above all, keep your goal in sight but your well-being intact. Whether one ultimately lands in graduate school or not, the process of preparing for *Kaoyan* is itself a formative journey. As countless students have learned, it teaches discipline, self-reflection, and endurance – qualities that will serve one in any endeavor. And as the stories of second-chancers and plan-changers show, there are many routes to a fulfilling “next chapter,” *with or without* a *Kaoyan* victory.

By examining the triumphs and tribulations of *Kaoyan* examinees over the years, we not only discern patterns of preparation and emotion, but also witness a microcosm of China’s educational and social changes. These personal narratives – sometimes bittersweet, sometimes inspiring – remind us that behind every exam score is a human story. And in those stories, we find both lessons and encouragement for all who continue to chase their dreams in the face of adversity.
