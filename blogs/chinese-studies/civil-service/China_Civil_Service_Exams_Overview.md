I’ll let you know once everything is ready so you can start slaying that exam prep with confidence.

# China's Civil Service Exams: National and Provincial Overview

China’s civil service examinations are famously competitive gateways to secure government jobs – often termed the “iron rice bowl” for their stability. These exams include the **national civil service exam (国考, *Guokao*)** as well as **provincial-level exams (省考, *Shengkao*)** administered by individual regions (such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Beijing). Below is a structured overview covering eligibility, application processes, exam structure, competitiveness, popular positions, preparation strategies, and key differences between the national and provincial exams.

## Eligibility Criteria

**General Requirements:** Both national and provincial civil service exams share similar baseline requirements. Candidates must be Chinese citizens aged roughly 18 to 35 (with upper age limits sometimes extended for those with postgraduate degrees or military service) ([2024北京公务员考试报考条件(基本要求+其他要求)- 北京本地宝](https://m.bj.bendibao.com/news/353513.html#:~:text=1)). A university degree (at least an associate’s or bachelor’s) is typically required, and candidates must possess good political and moral standing – including support for the Chinese Constitution and Communist Party leadership. Applicants should have no disqualifying criminal record or disciplinary violations, and must be in good health (meeting physical and psychological standards). 

**Work Experience:** Many positions, especially at higher levels, require some amount of grassroots work experience. For the **national exam**, central agencies usually seek candidates with **2+ years of基层工作经验** (grassroots experience) for mid-level roles, while entry-level openings at county and township organs often target **fresh college graduates**. Similarly, provincial exams may designate certain posts for experienced personnel versus recent graduates. For example, Beijing’s 2024 city-level agencies primarily recruited people with at least two years of experience, whereas district- and county-level jobs were mainly open to new graduates ([2024北京公务员考试报考条件(基本要求+其他要求)- 北京本地宝](https://m.bj.bendibao.com/news/353513.html#:~:text=8)). 

**Local Restrictions:** Provincial exams sometimes include residency or local background requirements for specific positions. Some provinces give preference to or *only* allow local **户籍** (household-registered residents) or local graduates to apply for grassroots roles, in order to retain talent in the region ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20Henan%20made%20it,stability%20of%20the%20grassroots%20team)) ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=%E7%94%9F%E6%BA%90%E5%BA%94%E5%B1%8A%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%EF%BC%9B%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%8C%BA%E6%99%AE%E9%80%9A%E9%AB%98%E7%AD%89%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%E9%9D%9E%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E7%94%9F%E6%BA%90%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%88%E5%90%AB%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%EF%BC%89%E5%BA%94%E5%B1%8A%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%EF%BC%9B%E4%BA%AC%E5%A4%96%E6%99%AE%E9%80%9A%E9%AB%98%E7%AD%89%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%E4%B8%AD%E6%9C%80%E9%AB%98%E5%AD%A6%E5%8E%86%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E6%9C%9F%E9%97%B4%E8%8E%B7%E5%BE%97%E6%A0%A1%E7%BA%A7%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%E2%80%9C%E4%B8%89%E5%A5%BD%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9C%E4%BC%98%E7%A7%80%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%B9%B2%E9%83%A8%E2%80%9D%E6%88%96%E8%80%85%E6%A0%A1%E7%BA%A7%E4%B8%80%20%E7%AD%89%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%E2%80%9C%E4%BC%98%E7%A7%80%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91%E2%80%9D%E7%9A%84%E9%9D%9E%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E7%94%9F%E6%BA%90%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%88%E5%90%AB%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%EF%BC%89%E5%BA%94%E5%B1%8A%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%EF%BC%88%E9%99%A4%E5%8F%A6%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E5%AE%9A%E5%A4%96%EF%BC%8C%E6%8A%A5%E8%80%83%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%B1%82%E4%B8%8A%E8%BF%B0%E8%B5%84%E6%A0%BC%E6%9D%A1%E4%BB%B6%EF%BC%89%E3%80%82)). Beijing’s municipal exam, for instance, reserves many posts for Beijing locals or for non-local graduates who meet certain merit criteria (such as holding top academic honors) ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=%E7%94%9F%E6%BA%90%E5%BA%94%E5%B1%8A%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%EF%BC%9B%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%8C%BA%E6%99%AE%E9%80%9A%E9%AB%98%E7%AD%89%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%E9%9D%9E%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E7%94%9F%E6%BA%90%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%88%E5%90%AB%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%EF%BC%89%E5%BA%94%E5%B1%8A%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%EF%BC%9B%E4%BA%AC%E5%A4%96%E6%99%AE%E9%80%9A%E9%AB%98%E7%AD%89%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%E4%B8%AD%E6%9C%80%E9%AB%98%E5%AD%A6%E5%8E%86%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E6%9C%9F%E9%97%B4%E8%8E%B7%E5%BE%97%E6%A0%A1%E7%BA%A7%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%E2%80%9C%E4%B8%89%E5%A5%BD%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9C%E4%BC%98%E7%A7%80%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%B9%B2%E9%83%A8%E2%80%9D%E6%88%96%E8%80%85%E6%A0%A1%E7%BA%A7%E4%B8%80%20%E7%AD%89%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%E2%80%9C%E4%BC%98%E7%A7%80%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91%E2%80%9D%E7%9A%84%E9%9D%9E%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E7%94%9F%E6%BA%90%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%88%E5%90%AB%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%EF%BC%89%E5%BA%94%E5%B1%8A%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%EF%BC%88%E9%99%A4%E5%8F%A6%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E5%AE%9A%E5%A4%96%EF%BC%8C%E6%8A%A5%E8%80%83%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%B1%82%E4%B8%8A%E8%BF%B0%E8%B5%84%E6%A0%BC%E6%9D%A1%E4%BB%B6%EF%BC%89%E3%80%82)). Additionally, special targeted openings exist for categories like **retired soldiers**, **service program volunteers**, or **persons with disabilities**, with eligibility confined to those groups ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=%E5%9C%A8%E5%86%9B%E9%98%9F%E6%9C%8D%E5%BD%B9%E4%BA%94%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%88%E5%90%AB%EF%BC%89%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A%E7%9A%84%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E7%B1%8D%E9%AB%98%E6%A0%A1%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%E9%80%80%E5%BD%B9%E5%A3%AB%E5%85%B5%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E6%8A%A5%E8%80%83%E9%9D%A2%E5%90%91%E6%9C%8D%E5%BD%B9%E6%9C%9F%E6%BB%A1%E9%80%80%E5%BD%B9%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%A3%AB%E5%85%B5%E7%9A%84%E6%8B%9B%E8%80%83%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%E3%80%82)) ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=5)). Candidates currently serving in the military, active civil servants, or full-time students (non-graduating) are generally *ineligible* to register for these exams ([2024北京公务员考试报考条件(基本要求+其他要求)- 北京本地宝](https://m.bj.bendibao.com/news/353513.html#:~:text=%E7%8E%B0%E5%BD%B9%E5%86%9B%E4%BA%BA%E3%80%81%E5%9C%A8%E8%AF%BB%E7%9A%84%E9%9D%9E%E5%BA%94%E5%B1%8A%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%E3%80%81%E5%9C%A8%E8%81%8C%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E5%92%8C%E5%8F%82%E7%85%A7%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E6%B3%95%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%BA%E5%85%B3)).

In summary, while the exact wording may vary by exam announcement, the core eligibility criteria emphasize Chinese nationality, age limits, educational credentials, political reliability, and (for many roles) either grassroots experience or fresh graduate status, along with any job-specific qualifications. Candidates must also avoid conflicts of interest (e.g. not applying to a position where an immediate family member is a supervising official) ([2024年国家公务员考试公告 - 国家公务员考试最新消息](https://www.chinagwy.org/html/kszc/gj/202310/42_606670.html#:~:text=%E4%BA%BA%E5%91%98%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E5%92%8C%E5%8F%82%E7%85%A7%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E6%B3%95%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%BA%E5%85%B3%EF%BC%88%E5%8D%95%E4%BD%8D%EF%BC%89%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E4%BA%BA%E5%91%98%E8%A2%AB%E8%BE%9E%E9%80%80%E6%9C%AA%E6%BB%A15%E5%B9%B4%E7%9A%84%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%A5%E5%8F%8A%E6%B3%95%E5%BE%8B%E6%B3%95%E8%A7%84%E8%A7%84%E5%AE%9A%E4%B8%8D%E5%BE%97%E5%BD%95%E7%94%A8%E4%B8%BA%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E7%9A%84%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E6%83%85%E5%BD%A2%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%E5%91%98%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E5%BE%97%E6%8A%A5%E8%80%83%E3%80%82)) and meet any specialized requirements listed for the post.

## Application Process and Timeline

**National Civil Service Exam (Guokao):** The national exam is held **once annually**, with the cycle typically starting in the fall. Each year, the central authorities (National Civil Service Administration) release an official recruitment announcement and position catalog around October. For example, the 2024 Guokao registration opened on **October 15, 2023 and closed on October 24, 2023**, with the written exams administered in late November 2023. Applicants submit their materials through the designated online portal (often the “考录专题网站”) during the registration window and choose a specific job opening to compete for. After submission, agencies review qualifications of each applicant. Those who pass this initial screening must **confirm their registration and pay an exam fee** by a given deadline (for 2025’s exam, this confirmation and payment took place in early November 2024). Admission tickets (准考证) are then issued for the written test date, typically scheduled on a weekend. The national written exam usually occurs in **late November or early December** nationwide, with all candidates sitting for the Administrative Aptitude Test in the morning and the essay-based Test of Application (described below) in the afternoon. Results of the written exam are published a couple of months later (around January), followed by interviews in March–April for those who qualify, and final offers by mid-year.

**Provincial Civil Service Exams (Shengkao):** Provincial exams are also held on an annual basis but follow a different schedule, often in the winter or spring. Many provinces coordinate a **joint exam date** each year so that their exams occur simultaneously – preventing candidates from taking multiple provincial exams in one cycle. In the 2024–2025 cycle, over 20 provinces held their written exams on **March 15, 2025** as part of a coordinated schedule ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=From%20December%20last%20year%20to,same%20day%20on%20March%2015)). These provinces (including Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, Hebei, Hunan, etc.) released their recruitment notices in late 2024 or early 2025 and allowed online applications roughly 1–2 months before the March exam ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=From%20December%20last%20year%20to,same%20day%20on%20March%2015)). For example, **Guangdong’s 2024 provincial exam** registration ran from **January 16 to January 22, 2024**, and the written test took place in March 2024. By contrast, some regions — often the more economically developed ones — opt out of the joint date and conduct their exams earlier. **Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Shandong** typically hold independent exams in the winter.

Likewise, Zhejiang and Shanghai held their 2025 intake exams between December 2024 and January 2025 ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=From%20December%20last%20year%20to,same%20day%20on%20March%2015)). This staggering of schedules allows ambitious candidates to attempt both the national exam and one provincial exam in a given cycle (since Guokao is in late fall and most province exams are a few months later).

**Application Steps:** The application process across exams is broadly similar: candidates fill out an online form, upload required information (ID, education, etc.), and select a specific job opening from the published **职位表** (position list). Each job listing details the number of vacancies, work location, required major/degree, experience, and any special conditions. Applicants can generally apply to only **one position per exam** cycle, so strategic choice is important. After the application period, candidates can often see the number of people vying for each post (many provinces periodically publish the **报名人数** per position during registration). This transparency sometimes allows applicants to switch to less-crowded positions before the deadline. Once the application is confirmed and fees paid, an admission ticket is issued indicating the test center location for the written exam. 

**Post-Written Exam:** Following the written tests, each jurisdiction sets a **minimum passing score** (often higher for popular regions or positions, and slightly lower for hard-to-fill remote roles as an affirmative policy) ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=%E6%8A%A5%E8%80%83%E8%80%85%E5%BA%94%E6%8C%89%E7%85%A7%E5%87%86%E8%80%83%E8%AF%81%E4%B8%8A%E7%A1%AE%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E5%88%B0%E7%9B%B8%E5%BA%94%E7%9A%84%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E5%9C%B0%E7%82%B9%E5%8F%82%E5%8A%A0%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E3%80%82%E5%8F%82%E5%8A%A0%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E6%97%B6%EF%BC%8C%E5%BF%85%E9%A1%BB%E5%90%8C%E6%97%B6%E6%90%BA%E5%B8%A6%E5%87%86%E8%80%83%E8%AF%81%E5%92%8C%E6%9C%AC%E4%BA%BA%E6%9C%89%E6%95%88%E5%B1%85%E6%B0%91%E8%BA%AB%E4%BB%BD%E8%AF%81%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%8E%E6%8A%A5%E5%90%8D%E6%97%B6%E4%B8%80%E8%87%B4%EF%BC%89%E3%80%82)). Those meeting the score threshold for their position are shortlisted for the next stage – typically an interview, and in some cases a **professional skills test** or physical fitness test for relevant roles (for instance, police and firefighting positions require an additional physical exam). Interviews are organized by the hiring department or a civil service board and usually occur 1–2 months after the written exam results. Final candidate selection combines the written and interview scores (commonly weighted 50/50 in most cases) ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=%E5%85%AC%E5%AE%89%E6%9C%BA%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E8%AD%A6%E5%AF%9F%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%E6%8C%89%E7%85%A7%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E8%81%8C%E4%B8%9A%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E6%B5%8B%E9%AA%8C%E3%80%81%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%E3%80%81%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E7%A7%91%E7%9B%AE%E5%88%86%E5%88%AB%E5%8D%A040)), and then candidates undergo a health check and background verification before formal appointment. The entire process from exam announcement to onboarding can span roughly half a year.

## Exam Structure and Subjects

Despite being administered separately, the national and provincial civil service exams have a very similar structure. The **written examination** consists of two main components for virtually all agencies: **(1) Administrative Aptitude Test (行测, *Xingce*)** and **(2) Essay-based Application Test (申论, *Shenlun*)**.

- **Administrative Aptitude Test (行测):** This is a **timed multiple-choice** exam given in the morning session (usually lasting about 2 hours) ([More than 1.4 million sit for civil service exam - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202111/29/WS61a3858ba310cdd39bc77f49.html#:~:text=During%20the%20test%2C%20candidates%20spent,in%20the%20afternoon%20writing%20essays)). It assesses a broad range of cognitive skills and general knowledge. The question categories typically include:  
  - *Language & verbal ability:* reading comprehension, sentence correction, and logic in Chinese.  
  - *Quantitative aptitude:* basic mathematics and arithmetic problem-solving (often story problems requiring quick calculation or number series logic).  
  - *Logical reasoning:* analytical puzzles, pattern recognition (e.g. sequence and analogy problems, sometimes including visual/figure logic), and judgment questions.  
  - *Data analysis:* interpretation of charts, tables, and statistical data; extracting conclusions from quantitative information.  
  - *General knowledge (常识判断):* a grab-bag of questions on Chinese law, government policies, economics, history, geography, technology, and current affairs.  

  All sub-sections are typically mixed into one exam booklet with a total of around **120–135 questions** (for example, the national exam has had 135 questions in recent years) which must be answered within the fixed time ([China's civil service exam: Can you answer these questions?](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-11/27/content_27495413.htm#:~:text=China%27s%20civil%20service%20exam%3A%20Can,to%20answer%20in%20two%20hours)). This demands a fast pace – on average less than one minute per question. The content is designed to evaluate the candidate’s **administrative aptitude** – essentially their reasoning speed, breadth of knowledge, and problem-solving under pressure. For instance, in a recent national exam, candidates had *“two hours in the morning answering questions pertaining to mathematics, logic, analysis, comprehension and common knowledge”* ([More than 1.4 million sit for civil service exam - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202111/29/WS61a3858ba310cdd39bc77f49.html#:~:text=During%20the%20test%2C%20candidates%20spent,in%20the%20afternoon%20writing%20essays)). 

- **Essay-Based Application Test (申论):** This is a **written communication and policy analysis exam** administered in the afternoon, typically for **2.5 to 3 hours** ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=2023%E5%B9%B412%E6%9C%883%E6%97%A5%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%88%2014%3A00%EF%BC%8D16%3A30%C2%A0%20%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA)) ([More than 1.4 million sit for civil service exam - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202111/29/WS61a3858ba310cdd39bc77f49.html#:~:text=During%20the%20test%2C%20candidates%20spent,in%20the%20afternoon%20writing%20essays)). In this section, candidates receive a packet of background materials on a particular topic (for example, excerpts from reports, statistics, or scenarios about a social or governmental issue). Based on these materials, the test will prompt a series of written tasks – for example: summarizing the provided materials, drafting a short memo or proposal, and writing an argumentative essay or policy analysis. The *Shenlun* exam aims to gauge the applicant’s **ability to understand public issues, formulate solutions or advice, and express themselves in a clear, logical and official writing style**. It effectively tests writing skills, analytical thinking, and familiarity with government policy themes. Candidates typically must produce answers in essay or paragraph form (handwritten on answer sheets), following the official document formats if specified (e.g. writing a government report, a policy briefing, a letter to citizens, etc.). 

Both the aptitude test and the essay test are **mandatory** for all civil service examinees (with the exception of a few specialized hires). The two scores are weighted (often equally at 50% each) to form the total written exam score ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=%E5%85%AC%E5%AE%89%E6%9C%BA%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E8%AD%A6%E5%AF%9F%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%E6%8C%89%E7%85%A7%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E8%81%8C%E4%B8%9A%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E6%B5%8B%E9%AA%8C%E3%80%81%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%E3%80%81%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E7%A7%91%E7%9B%AE%E5%88%86%E5%88%AB%E5%8D%A040)). For certain special positions, **additional subject tests** are required. For example, applicants for **public security (police) roles** usually must take an extra **Police Professional Exam** covering law, criminology, etc., which might be scheduled on a separate day ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=2023%E5%B9%B412%E6%9C%883%E6%97%A5%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%88%2014%3A00%EF%BC%8D16%3A30%C2%A0%20%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA)). In Beijing’s exam, the police professional test was a two-hour paper held the day before the general exams ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=2023%E5%B9%B412%E6%9C%883%E6%97%A5%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%88%2014%3A00%EF%BC%8D16%3A30%C2%A0%20%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA)). Other examples include foreign language proficiency tests for roles in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or computer/finance knowledge tests for some technical positions – these are noted in the job listings when applicable. 

It’s worth noting that the **question content is quite standardized nationwide**. The vast majority of provinces use an exam format and question style very close to the national exam’s, so the subjects and question types do not vary drastically between a provincial exam and the Guokao. (Indeed, many prep textbooks can be used for both.) Only a few locations like *Guangdong* or *Shanghai* have been known to introduce more localized question styles or slightly different emphases in their aptitude tests ([90天公务员考试上岸经验分享（内附免费考试资料包）](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/594880009#:~:text=90%E5%A4%A9%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%EF%BC%88%E5%86%85%E9%99%84%E5%85%8D%E8%B4%B9%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99%E5%8C%85%EF%BC%89%20%E9%99%A4%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%AA%E5%88%AB%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E5%A6%82%E5%B9%BF%E4%B8%9C%E3%80%81%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E7%AD%89%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E5%B7%AE%E5%BC%82%E8%BE%83%E5%A4%A7%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96%EF%BC%8C%E7%BB%9D%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%9A%E6%95%B0%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E3%80%81%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%E7%9A%84%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9%E4%B8%8E%E5%9B%BD%E8%80%83%E4%B8%80%E8%87%B4%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E3%80%82%20%E6%89%80%E4%BB%A5%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9%E7%9B%B8%E5%90%8C%EF%BC%8C%E5%A4%8D%E4%B9%A0%E5%A4%87%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E4%B9%9F%E7%9B%B8%E5%90%8C%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8B%E9%9D%A2%E5%B0%B1%E6%9D%A5%20)). In recent years the national exam itself has been split into different versions for different groups of positions – for example, separate question sets for **central vs. local positions, and a separate paper for law enforcement positions** ([More than 1.4 million sit for civil service exam - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202111/29/WS61a3858ba310cdd39bc77f49.html#:~:text=The%20exam%20has%20been%20split,enforcement%20positions%2C%20a%20new%20addition)). This means a candidate taking the national exam for a tax officer job in a provincial office might get a slightly different paper than someone aiming for a Beijing ministry job or a border customs enforcement job, tailored to those roles. Despite these nuances, the core subjects (administrative abilities and essay writing) remain consistent across all civil service exams.

After the written exam phase, those who qualify proceed to **interviews**. The interview stage (often structured panel interviews) further evaluates candidates on qualities like presentation, problem-solving, and demeanor. For some technical jobs, an additional practical ability test or case study discussion may be conducted during the interview phase ([北京市各级机关2024年度考试录用公务员公告_公务员招考_首都之窗_北京市人民政府门户网站](https://www.beijing.gov.cn/gongkai/rsxx/gwyzk/202311/t20231110_3299396.html#:~:text=%E7%BB%8F%E8%B5%84%E6%A0%BC%E5%A4%8D%E5%AE%A1%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E8%BE%BE%E5%88%B0%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E7%A7%91%E7%9B%AE%E7%AC%94%E8%AF%95%E6%9C%80%E4%BD%8E%E5%90%88%E6%A0%BC%E5%88%86%E6%95%B0%E7%BA%BF%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%E6%95%B0%E4%B8%8E%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92%E5%BD%95%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%BA%E6%95%B0%E6%AF%94%E4%BE%8B%E4%BD%8E%E4%BA%8E%E8%A7%84%E5%AE%9A%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%E6%AF%94%E4%BE%8B%E7%9A%84%E6%8B%9B%E8%80%83%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%EF%BC%8C%E5%B0%86%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E3%80%82%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%E3%80%81%E7%AC%A6%E5%90%88%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E6%9D%A1%E4%BB%B6%E7%9A%84%E8%80%83%E7%94%9F%E5%90%8D%E5%8D%95%E3%80%81%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%E8%81%94%E7%B3%BB%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F%EF%BC%8C%20%E5%9C%A8%E2%80%9C%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%B8%82%E4%BA%BA%E4%BA%8B%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0%E2%80%9D%E7%BB%9F%E4%B8%80%E5%85%AC%E5%B8%83%E3%80%82%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E6%8A%A5%E5%90%8D%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E9%87%87%E5%8F%96%E7%BD%91%E4%B8%8A%E6%8A%A5%E5%90%8D%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%EF%BC%8C%E7%AC%94%E8%AF%95%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9%E8%BE%BE%E5%88%B0%E5%90%88%E6%A0%BC%E5%88%86%E6%95%B0%E7%BA%BF%E4%B8%94%E7%AC%A6%E5%90%88%E6%8B%9F%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D%E8%B5%84%E6%A0%BC%E6%9D%A1%E4%BB%B6%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%E5%91%98%EF%BC%8C%E6%96%B9%E5%8F%AF%E5%8F%82%E5%8A%A0%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E3%80%82%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%E9%80%89%EF%BC%8C%E6%8C%89%E7%85%A7%E8%B0%83%20%E5%89%82%E6%8A%A5%E5%90%8D%E4%BA%BA%E5%91%98%E7%AC%94%E8%AF%95%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9%E4%BB%8E%E9%AB%98%E5%88%B0%E4%BD%8E%E7%9A%84%E9%A1%BA%E5%BA%8F%E7%A1%AE%E5%AE%9A%E3%80%82%E8%B5%84%E6%A0%BC%E5%A4%8D%E5%AE%A1%E3%80%81%E8%B0%83%E5%89%82%E6%8A%A5%E5%90%8D%E7%AD%89%E5%85%B7%E4%BD%93%E4%BA%8B%E5%AE%9C%E5%92%8C%E7%AC%94%E8%AF%95%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9%E5%90%8C%E6%97%B6%E5%85%AC%E5%B8%83%E3%80%82)). Finally, combined scores determine the final ranking for each position, and top-ranked candidates are admitted.

## Competitiveness and Acceptance Rates

Entry into civil service through these exams is **extremely competitive**. In recent years, record numbers of candidates have been vying for a limited pool of positions, making the exams statistically harder to pass than entrance to many elite universities. 

- **National Exam Competition:** The national civil service exam sees **millions of applicants each year**. For the 2024 intake (exams held in late 2023), over **3.03 million** candidates passed the qualification screening to take the exam. They were competing for about **39,600 advertised vacancies**, an average ratio of ~77 applicants per position. By the 2025 intake, the numbers climbed further: **3.416 million** qualified candidates competing for **39,721 positions** ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Civil,applicants%20to%20positions%20is%2086%3A1)). This equates to roughly **86 candidates vying for each spot on average** ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Civil,applicants%20to%20positions%20is%2086%3A1)) – meaning an overall acceptance rate around 1.2%. Moreover, these are just the candidates who made it through the initial eligibility review; the number of people who register interest can be even higher. The competition intensity has been on the rise – 2025 marked the seventh consecutive year of expanding recruitment yet also saw record-high applicants ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=This%20year%20marks%20the%20seventh,or%20district%20level%20and%20below)). 

  It’s important to note that the **competition is not evenly distributed**. Some highly sought-after jobs attract an astronomical number of aspirants. Each year, media reports highlight the “最热职位” (hottest position). In the 2024 national exam, the most applied-for job had **3,572 qualified candidates for 1 opening**. In 2025, a new record was set when a position with the **China Vocational Education Association** drew **16,702 applicants for a single vacancy** ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=The%20most%20competitive%20position%2C%20with,a%20bachelor%27s%20degree%20and%20above)). These “popular” jobs typically have minimal barriers to apply (e.g. open to any major nationwide, no experience required, and sometimes located in desirable areas or central ministries), thereby inviting a flood of applicants ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=The%20most%20competitive%20position%2C%20with,a%20bachelor%27s%20degree%20and%20above)). On the other hand, some positions have much lower ratios – especially those requiring very specialized skills or those in remote, hardship locations. A few posts even go unfilled if no candidate meets the criteria or if nobody applies. For example, in the 2024 Guangdong provincial exam, by the end of the registration period a handful of positions (8 vacancies) had zero applicants due to their strict requirements or less appealing conditions.

- **Provincial Exam Competition:** Provincial-level civil service exams are also quite competitive, though the exact odds vary by province and year. In general, provinces collectively attract a number of candidates comparable to or greater than the national exam (since there are many more provincial jobs in total, spread across all regions). In 2024, an estimate of *1.95 million* people sat various provincial and local civil service exams around January (a figure mentioned in news reports). The competitiveness in provinces is often described in terms of **dozens of candidates per seat on average**. For instance:
  - **Guangdong Province:** In 2024, Guangdong planned to hire **17,307 civil servants** across the province and saw about **170,000+ candidates** successfully register by the deadline. This yielded an average competition ratio of roughly **10 or 11 to 1** (10.8:1 by mid-registration). By the close of applications, the average may have been slightly higher, but still far less competitive than the national exam. However, this average hides the variation: certain positions in Guangdong were fiercely contested. The most competitive post in the 2024 Guangdong exam was a township-level **administrative enforcement officer** role (甲子镇人民政府一级行政执法员) which had **270 candidates for 1 opening**. In contrast, some rural posts had very few applicants, bringing down the average.
  - **Other provinces:** Many provinces report average ratios in the range of 20:1 to 50:1. Less developed western regions sometimes see high ratios because the number of openings is smaller relative to the pool of local job-seekers. Gansu’s 2025 exam, for example, had **192,700 people registering for 5,360 jobs** – about **36:1 on average**, the highest on record there ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20Gansu%20Province%20plans,both%20hit%20a%20record%20high)). Qinghai’s 2025 exam saw **115,600 applicants for 3,182 posts**, also around **36:1** ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20Gansu%20Province%20plans,both%20hit%20a%20record%20high)). In populous metropolitan areas like **Chongqing**, the 2025 exam drew over **232,000 applicants for ~5,500 positions**, averaging ~42:1; in that exam, multiple jobs exceeded **400:1** competition, with the toughest seeing **548:1** ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=This%20year%2C%20Chongqing%20plans%20to,is%20as%20high%20as%20548%3A1)) ([23.2万余人报考2025重庆公务员考试最热岗位548人报考](https://www.cq.chinanews.com.cn/news/2025/0303/36-11443.html#:~:text=%E4%BB%8E%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E6%AF%94%E6%9D%A5%E7%9C%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%8A%A5%E8%80%83%E4%B8%AD%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E6%AF%94%E6%9C%80%E9%AB%98%E7%9A%84%E5%B2%97%E4%BD%8D%E6%98%AF%E7%9F%B3%E6%9F%B1%E5%8E%BF%E8%A5%BF%E6%B2%B1%E9%95%87%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%8B%9B%E8%81%98%E7%9A%84%E2%80%9C%E7%BB%BC%E5%90%88%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D2%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%8C%E6%8B%9B%E8%81%981%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E7%BC%B4%E8%B4%B9%E4%BA%BA%E6%95%B0%E4%B8%BA548%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E6%AF%94%E8%BE%BE%E5%88%B0548%EF%BC%9A1%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E6%9C%80%E6%BF%80%E7%83%88%E7%9A%84%E5%B2%97%E4%BD%8D%E3%80%82)). Meanwhile, Beijing’s 2024 municipal exam (with around 4,300 vacancies) likely had tens of thousands of candidates, yielding ratios on par with other provinces (exact figures vary by position; many city posts see over 100:1). One interesting data point from the national exam: **Tibet (Xizang) Autonomous Region** had the highest regional competition in 2025’s Guokao – about **150 candidates per slot on average** ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=Regarding%20regional%20interest%2C%20Guangdong%20province,position%20ratio%20is%20nearly%20150%3A1)) – reflecting that when few positions are offered in a region, the relative ratio can spike even if the absolute applicant number is not the highest.

In summary, landing a civil service job through these exams is statistically challenging. Overall success rates for national exam takers hover around **1-2%** (for every 100 examinees, only 1 or 2 will ultimately be hired). Provincial exams have somewhat better odds on average (perhaps in the range of 2-5% success rate), but still extremely competitive by any measure. Candidates often prepare for months or years, and it’s common for individuals to attempt the exams multiple times. The intense competition is driven by the attractiveness of government jobs (stable career, benefits) especially amid a large supply of college graduates each year and a slowing job market ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=This%20year%20marks%20the%20seventh,or%20district%20level%20and%20below)) ([More than 1.4 million sit for civil service exam - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202111/29/WS61a3858ba310cdd39bc77f49.html#:~:text=A%20nuclear%20physics%20graduate%2C%20Chen,relieved%20after%20finishing%20the%20exam)).

## Popular Job Positions and Departments

Within the myriad positions offered in these exams, certain jobs consistently emerge as **most popular** among candidates. Popularity is usually a function of **desirability of the job and accessibility of the requirements**:

- **Central Level (Guokao):** In the national exam, positions in **central government ministries and agencies** located in major cities (especially Beijing) are highly coveted. Every year, roles in agencies like the **Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Taxation Administration, Customs, National Bureau of Statistics, central Communist Party organs, and other State ministries** receive large numbers of applications. However, it is often the positions with the **least restrictive qualifications** – sometimes in lesser-known departments – that top the charts for number of applicants. These are sometimes nicknamed “三不限” positions, meaning *no restriction on major, no restriction on experience, and no restriction on residency*. For example, in the 2024 cycle, the single most applied-for national job was with the **Ningxia branch of the National Bureau of Statistics** (a relatively modest central post in a western region) which had a staggering 3,500+ candidates for one opening. The reason, as explained by exam analysts, was that this position had a *“not-so-high entry threshold”* – it only required a master’s degree in a broad range of majors and no prior work experience, making it accessible to a huge pool of young graduates. Similarly in 2025, the **China Vocational Education Association** role that broke the record had very broad eligibility (open to anyone nationwide with a bachelor’s degree in any major, with relaxed hukou requirements) ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=The%20most%20competitive%20position%2C%20with,a%20bachelor%27s%20degree%20and%20above)). Jobs that fit this profile (broad eligibility, decent location or central affiliation) become magnets for applicants. 

  More traditionally, **administrative and enforcement positions** form the bulk of national recruitment (over 70% of the positions in 2024 were in administrative law enforcement at the grassroots or front-line level). This includes jobs in areas like taxation offices, customs and immigration border posts, public security, judicial administration, market regulators, etc. Among these, postings in attractive locales (e.g., coastal cities or one’s home province) see heavier competition. Conversely, positions that require very specific technical degrees (say, an aerospace engineer at a research institute) or that are located in very remote, hardship areas (like certain Tibetan or far western counties) often see fewer candidates – though as noted, even some remote jobs can become unexpectedly popular if they have “no limits” eligibility. For instance, one year a postal service job in the remote **Ngari prefecture of Tibet** turned out to have the fiercest competition nationally ([More than 1.4 million sit for civil service exam - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202111/29/WS61a3858ba310cdd39bc77f49.html#:~:text=Among%20positions%20being%20offered%20in,the%20National%20Civil%20Service%20Administration)), likely because it was open to many majors and people applied en masse despite (or not realizing) the harsh location.

- **Provincial Level (Shengkao):** In provincial exams, popularity trends can differ by region but generally mirror the idea that **urban postings and broadly eligible jobs attract the most applicants**. Positions in provincial capitals or prosperous cities (e.g. Guangzhou/Shenzhen in Guangdong, Hangzhou in Zhejiang, Nanjing/Suzhou in Jiangsu, etc.) are quite popular, as they often come with better career prospects or living conditions. For example, within Guangdong’s 2024 exam, roles in developed Pearl River Delta cities were highly sought. We saw the top 270:1 competition for a **township-level officer in Shanwei** – indicating even county/town positions can heat up if the eligibility is wide (that particular job likely did not require specific experience or a specialized degree, hence 270 people jumped at it). In **Chongqing’s** exam, the hottest job was a **general administration post in a rural town government** that only required a junior college diploma and had no specific major requirement – it reached a 548:1 ratio ([23.2万余人报考2025重庆公务员考试最热岗位548人报考](https://www.cq.chinanews.com.cn/news/2025/0303/36-11443.html#:~:text=%E4%BB%8E%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E6%AF%94%E6%9D%A5%E7%9C%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%8A%A5%E8%80%83%E4%B8%AD%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E6%AF%94%E6%9C%80%E9%AB%98%E7%9A%84%E5%B2%97%E4%BD%8D%E6%98%AF%E7%9F%B3%E6%9F%B1%E5%8E%BF%E8%A5%BF%E6%B2%B1%E9%95%87%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%8B%9B%E8%81%98%E7%9A%84%E2%80%9C%E7%BB%BC%E5%90%88%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E8%81%8C%E4%BD%8D2%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%8C%E6%8B%9B%E8%81%981%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E7%BC%B4%E8%B4%B9%E4%BA%BA%E6%95%B0%E4%B8%BA548%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E6%AF%94%E8%BE%BE%E5%88%B0548%EF%BC%9A1%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E7%AB%9E%E4%BA%89%E6%9C%80%E6%BF%80%E7%83%88%E7%9A%84%E5%B2%97%E4%BD%8D%E3%80%82)). These examples underscore that **“ease of eligibility” is a key driver** of applications: many candidates essentially target any government job they qualify for, so the ones with minimal barriers end up with huge applicant pools. 

  Popular departments at the local level include **revenue/tax offices, public security bureaus (police), courts and procuratorates (judicial clerks), customs (in port cities), municipal administration, and various regulatory agencies**. Within provinces, positions at **provincial departmental offices** (省直机关) or at **major city government offices** tend to have more prestige and thus higher demand than those in distant counties. However, provinces also often designate some positions specifically for local residents or with incentives for serving in rural areas, which can moderate competition for those posts.

- **“Iron Rice Bowl” Appeal:** Generally speaking, civil service jobs are considered secure, with decent benefits and social status, which is why **millions of young Chinese are drawn to these exams every year**. In recent years, with a record number of college graduates entering a softer job market, the appeal of stable government employment has only grown ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=This%20year%20marks%20the%20seventh,or%20district%20level%20and%20below)) ([More than 1.4 million sit for civil service exam - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202111/29/WS61a3858ba310cdd39bc77f49.html#:~:text=A%20nuclear%20physics%20graduate%2C%20Chen,relieved%20after%20finishing%20the%20exam)). This has created scenarios where even relatively modest government jobs (in terms of salary or location) are seen as golden opportunities if they offer a stable government headcount (编制). This dynamic explains why even postings in remote areas or at the grassroots can see hundreds of applicants: many candidates are eager to get a foot in the door of the civil service, with the possibility of later transferring to more desirable locations or climbing the ladder.

In conclusion, the “popular” positions are not necessarily the highest-paying or most glamorous, but those that are within reach of a large number of candidates and still offer the long-term benefits of a government career. Aspiring civil servants therefore often cast a wide net, applying for any position they qualify for – and thus certain jobs become nationwide “hot tickets” each cycle.

## Recommended Study Resources and Preparation Strategies

Preparing for the civil service exam is a major undertaking. Given the breadth of topics and the stiff competition, successful candidates typically prepare extensively using a combination of official guidance and third-party resources. Below are common **resources and strategies**:

- **Official Exam Announcements and Syllabus:** Each year, along with the exam announcement, the authorities release an **official exam syllabus (考试大纲)** for the Administrative Aptitude Test and the Shenlun. This syllabus outlines the scope of knowledge and question types to expect. It is highly recommended to **study the exam outline closely**, as it pinpoints what may be tested and even provides example questions ([国家公务员考试备考教材书籍推荐：行测+申论题册-高顿教育](https://www.gaodun.com/gwy/1601280.html#:~:text=%E9%A6%96%E5%85%88%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%B6%E9%9C%80%E8%A6%81%E6%98%8E%E7%A1%AE%E4%B8%80%E7%82%B9%EF%BC%8C%E5%8D%B3%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%AE%98%E6%96%B9%E6%8C%87%E5%AE%9A%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%EF%BC%8C%E6%89%80%E6%9C%89%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E9%83%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%8F%82%E8%80%83%EF%BC%8C%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E9%80%82%E5%90%88%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%B0%B1%E5%A5%BD%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%AE%9C%E7%B2%BE%E4%B8%8D%E5%AE%9C%E5%A4%9A%EF%BC%8C%E8%83%BD%E5%AD%A6%E5%88%B0%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E5%B0%B1%E8%A1%8C%E3%80%82)). The syllabus is essentially the “authoritative guide” on the exam content – for instance, it will list categories under logical reasoning (analogy, syllogism, etc.) or under general knowledge (constitutional law, economics, current events of the past year, etc.). Many experts suggest using the syllabus as a checklist to guide your studies, ensuring you cover all topic areas mentioned.

- **Past Exam Papers and Question Banks:** Practicing with real exam questions from previous years is crucial. There are compilations of **历年真题** (actual past papers) available for both Guokao and various provincial exams. Working through these helps candidates become familiar with the question format and time constraints. Because many question patterns repeat or follow a certain style, drilling past questions can significantly improve speed and accuracy. **Timed practice** for the aptitude test is particularly important due to the time pressure. There are books and PDF collections of past exams, and some are shared freely on forums or repositories ([公务员，省考行测申论考试题库17+ - App Store](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98-%E7%9C%81%E8%80%83%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E9%A2%98%E5%BA%93/id1617246225?l=en-GB#:~:text=%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%EF%BC%8C%E7%9C%81%E8%80%83%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E9%A2%98%E5%BA%9317%2B%20,%C2%B7%202%E3%80%81%E5%81%9A%E9%A2%98%2F%E8%83%8C%E9%A2%98%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F%E5%88%87%E6%8D%A2%EF%BC%8C%E9%A2%98%E5%BA%93%E6%8C%89%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E7%82%B9%E5%88%86%E7%B1%BB%EF%BC%8C%E8%A6%86%E7%9B%96%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E6%89%80%E6%9C%89%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E7%82%B9%EF%BC%8C%E9%92%88%E5%AF%B9%E6%80%A7%E8%81%94%E7%B3%BB%EF%BC%8C)).

- **Prep Books and Guides:** A large industry of civil service exam prep materials exists. There is **no single official textbook** designated by the government ([国家公务员考试备考教材书籍推荐：行测+申论题册-高顿教育](https://www.gaodun.com/gwy/1601280.html#:~:text=%E9%A6%96%E5%85%88%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%B6%E9%9C%80%E8%A6%81%E6%98%8E%E7%A1%AE%E4%B8%80%E7%82%B9%EF%BC%8C%E5%8D%B3%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%AE%98%E6%96%B9%E6%8C%87%E5%AE%9A%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%EF%BC%8C%E6%89%80%E6%9C%89%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E9%83%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%8F%82%E8%80%83%EF%BC%8C%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E9%80%82%E5%90%88%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%B0%B1%E5%A5%BD%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%AE%9C%E7%B2%BE%E4%B8%8D%E5%AE%9C%E5%A4%9A%EF%BC%8C%E8%83%BD%E5%AD%A6%E5%88%B0%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E5%B0%B1%E8%A1%8C%E3%80%82)), so private publishers and training centers have filled the gap. Popular prep book series (题库/教材) cover each section of the exam in depth – for example, books on **administrative ability test** that teach techniques for math shortcuts, logic puzzles, etc., and **Shenlun writing guides** that provide sample essays and frameworks for analyzing policy topics. Some well-known exam prep companies in China include **华图教育 (Huatu)**, **中公教育 (Offcn)**, **粉笔公考 (Chalk)**, and **高顿公考**. They produce guidebooks and also offer intensive classes or online courses. These materials often break down the 行测 into its subtypes and give practice drills for each. For 申论, prep books often supply collections of sample essays, templates for different document formats, and hot topic discussions (since essay themes often relate to recent policy initiatives or social issues).

- **Online Resources and Apps:** There are mobile apps and websites where one can practice civil service questions on the go. For instance, apps like **“公考刷题”** or **“粉笔公考”** provide thousands of practice questions and even daily quizzes on current affairs. Some platforms provide analytics to identify your weak areas. Additionally, many people follow **public accounts on WeChat** or **online forums** (like civil servant exam tieba or Zhihu columns) where tips and free materials are shared. In recent years, there have been crowdsourced repositories (even GitHub projects) sharing study notes and question databases ([GitHub - hwlvipone/yunduanqiqu: 最新公务员考试、公考资料免费分享](https://github.com/hwlvipone/yunduanqiqu#:~:text=GitHub%20)), as well as MOOCs for sections like logical reasoning.

- **Study Timeline and Strategies:** Most serious candidates devote several months of study before the exam. A common strategy is to **focus first on the 行测** (aptitude test) since it covers a wide array of quick-answer questions that require technique to solve efficiently. Many begin by building up speed in solving math and logic questions and memorizing common knowledge facts (e.g., constitutional provisions, national strategies, economic data). It’s often suggested to **take timed mock exams** weekly to build stamina. For the **申论**, reading official news (like People’s Daily, Xinhua) and government policy reports can help one get used to the writing style and relevant vocabulary. Candidates practice by writing essay responses to prompts and then comparing them with high-scoring sample answers or scoring rubrics provided by coaching agencies. Getting feedback on Shenlun writing (either from peers or tutors) can be very beneficial, as one needs to learn how to structure answers and make pertinent points from the given materials. 

- **Join a Class or Group:** Many aspirants enroll in intensive **training classes (辅导班)** offered by the aforementioned education companies, especially during the summer or winter break before the exam. These classes can be in-person bootcamps or live online sessions, covering tips and likely question trends. While not mandatory, such training can provide discipline and expert feedback. For those studying on their own, forming a study group with friends or online peers to discuss difficult questions or grade each other’s essays is a popular approach to stay motivated.

- **Interview Preparation:** Since passing the written exam is only part of the battle, top candidates also prepare for the **interview phase**. This involves staying informed about current events (so you can answer policy questions or discuss your view on social issues), and practicing common interview questions (like how to respond to a hypothetical scenario in a government role). Some provinces conduct **structured interviews or role-play exercises**, so familiarity with those formats helps. There are also books and courses on the 面试 portion, often emphasizing demeanor, political acumen in answers, and knowledge of the specific department you applied to.

In essence, preparation for the civil service exams is a marathon of studying factual knowledge, honing fast problem-solving skills, and practicing clear writing. Utilizing the official exam outline as a roadmap and complementing it with extensive practice (via books, past papers, or courses) is the widely recommended strategy ([国家公务员考试备考教材书籍推荐：行测+申论题册-高顿教育](https://www.gaodun.com/gwy/1601280.html#:~:text=%E9%A6%96%E5%85%88%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%B6%E9%9C%80%E8%A6%81%E6%98%8E%E7%A1%AE%E4%B8%80%E7%82%B9%EF%BC%8C%E5%8D%B3%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%AE%98%E6%96%B9%E6%8C%87%E5%AE%9A%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%EF%BC%8C%E6%89%80%E6%9C%89%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E9%83%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%8F%82%E8%80%83%EF%BC%8C%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E9%80%82%E5%90%88%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%B0%B1%E5%A5%BD%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%AE%9C%E7%B2%BE%E4%B8%8D%E5%AE%9C%E5%A4%9A%EF%BC%8C%E8%83%BD%E5%AD%A6%E5%88%B0%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E5%B0%B1%E8%A1%8C%E3%80%82)) ([国家公务员考试备考教材书籍推荐：行测+申论题册-高顿教育](https://www.gaodun.com/gwy/1601280.html#:~:text=%E4%BA%8C%E3%80%81%E5%88%B7%E9%A2%98%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%EF%BC%9A%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%2B%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%E9%A2%98%E5%86%8C)). Given the low odds of success, many examinees treat preparation almost like a part-time job, dedicating consistent daily hours to it. The payoff for those who succeed is a stable career start in China’s government system.

## Differences Between the National and Provincial Exams

While the **content and format** of the national vs. provincial civil service exams are similar, there are a few key differences and distinctions to be aware of:

- **Scope of Recruitment:** The **national exam (Guokao)** is a centralized exam to fill positions in **central government ministries, agencies, and their field branches** across the country. Passing the Guokao is essentially applying for jobs under the central government system (including State Council ministries, central Communist Party organs, and centrally administered institutions like customs, taxation, central bank, etc.). In contrast, a **provincial exam (Shengkao)** recruits for positions in that **province’s own government system** – this includes the provincial departments, city/municipal governments, county governments, and local branches of provincial agencies. For example, someone who passes the Zhejiang provincial exam might become a clerk in a Zhejiang county government or a police officer in Hangzhou, but not a Beijing-based ministry official. **Mobility**: Generally, if you enter via a provincial exam, your career is initially in that province’s system (though later one could pursue national-level jobs via separate internal exams or transfers). National exam hires typically start in central agencies or their local offices and might have more chance to move between provinces as part of a central agency’s postings. 

- **Exam Scheduling and Frequency:** As described earlier, the **national exam is held once a year in the last quarter** of the year (with the exam in Nov/Dec), whereas **provincial exams are usually held in the first half** of the year (often spring). Provinces either coordinate on a single exam date (e.g., many held on mid-March in 2024 ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=From%20December%20last%20year%20to,same%20day%20on%20March%2015))) or run their own schedule slightly earlier (Dec–Jan). This means a candidate can attempt the Guokao and one province’s exam in the same cycle. If unsuccessful, they can try again the next year. The offset schedules also mean result announcements and interview timelines differ (Guokao interviews in early spring vs. provincial interviews in summer). Also, each province typically has **one exam cycle per year** (some smaller provinces might skip a year if there’s a hiring freeze, but lately most conduct annually). So, in terms of frequency, both are usually annual opportunities, but timing differs.

- **Administrative Differences:** **Application process** is administered by different bodies – Guokao applications go through the National Civil Service Administration’s portal (often **scs.gov.cn** and related official sites), whereas each province has its own **Human Resources or Personnel department** running the provincial exam. For instance, Beijing uses the **Beijing Personnel Exam Portal**, Guangdong uses a portal under its Human Resources department, etc. Consequently, the **position pools do not overlap**: you cannot apply to a central government job via a provincial exam or vice versa. Also, **qualification review and hiring** are managed separately. A person could theoretically pass both a national and a provincial exam in one year; they would then choose which path to proceed with (one cannot hold two government posts, of course). 

- **Content and Difficulty:** The **core content** (subjects) of the exams is essentially the same (行政能力测验 and 申论) ([90天公务员考试上岸经验分享（内附免费考试资料包）](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/594880009#:~:text=90%E5%A4%A9%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%EF%BC%88%E5%86%85%E9%99%84%E5%85%8D%E8%B4%B9%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99%E5%8C%85%EF%BC%89%20%E9%99%A4%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%AA%E5%88%AB%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E5%A6%82%E5%B9%BF%E4%B8%9C%E3%80%81%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E7%AD%89%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E5%B7%AE%E5%BC%82%E8%BE%83%E5%A4%A7%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96%EF%BC%8C%E7%BB%9D%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%9A%E6%95%B0%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E3%80%81%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%E7%9A%84%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9%E4%B8%8E%E5%9B%BD%E8%80%83%E4%B8%80%E8%87%B4%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E3%80%82%20%E6%89%80%E4%BB%A5%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9%E7%9B%B8%E5%90%8C%EF%BC%8C%E5%A4%8D%E4%B9%A0%E5%A4%87%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E4%B9%9F%E7%9B%B8%E5%90%8C%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8B%E9%9D%A2%E5%B0%B1%E6%9D%A5%20)), and the question style is largely uniform nationwide due to the exam syllabus standardization. However, some examinees perceive that the **national exam’s questions can be slightly more challenging** or nuanced, given it’s a nationwide competition. The time pressure and complexity might be turned up a notch in Guokao, but this is somewhat subjective. Most provincial papers are on par with the national paper in difficulty, and in some cases provinces reuse similar question patterns. There are a few exceptions: provinces like **Guangdong and Shanghai** have been known to include unique question types or adjusted difficulty in the 行测 section ([90天公务员考试上岸经验分享（内附免费考试资料包）](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/594880009#:~:text=90%E5%A4%A9%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%EF%BC%88%E5%86%85%E9%99%84%E5%85%8D%E8%B4%B9%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99%E5%8C%85%EF%BC%89%20%E9%99%A4%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%AA%E5%88%AB%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E5%A6%82%E5%B9%BF%E4%B8%9C%E3%80%81%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E7%AD%89%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E5%B7%AE%E5%BC%82%E8%BE%83%E5%A4%A7%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%96%EF%BC%8C%E7%BB%9D%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%9A%E6%95%B0%E7%9C%81%E4%BB%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E3%80%81%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%E7%9A%84%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9%E4%B8%8E%E5%9B%BD%E8%80%83%E4%B8%80%E8%87%B4%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%99%E6%9D%90%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E3%80%82%20%E6%89%80%E4%BB%A5%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9%E7%9B%B8%E5%90%8C%EF%BC%8C%E5%A4%8D%E4%B9%A0%E5%A4%87%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E4%B9%9F%E7%9B%B8%E5%90%8C%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8B%E9%9D%A2%E5%B0%B1%E6%9D%A5%20)). Additionally, **Jiangsu** historically had a distinct format where they used different test categories (A, B, C papers) depending on the job level or applicant’s education level – meaning the exam content could differ for, say, a position requiring a postgraduate degree vs. one requiring only a college diploma. These local variances aside, a candidate preparing for one exam would not need to radically change approach for another; study materials and techniques are largely interchangeable across Guokao and provincial exams.

- **Regional Orientation:** In the **申论 (essay) section**, sometimes the **context of the questions might reflect national vs local focus**. For instance, the national exam’s essay topic might be about a broad national policy issue, whereas a provincial exam’s essay could be subtly tailored to local governance topics (e.g., an essay scenario about rural development might use a setting from that province). Likewise, the **interview stage** questions for provincial jobs might include local language (dialect proficiency) or local policy knowledge, whereas central agencies might expect awareness of national and international issues. However, these differences are more about emphasis during hiring rather than the written test content itself. 

- **Competition Levels:** Generally, **national exam is more competitive overall** (higher candidates-to-post ratio) than most single provincial exams, because it draws from a national pool of aspirants and includes prestigious central government jobs. Provincial exams, while still competitive, can offer *slightly* better odds on average. For example, the national exam saw ~86:1 average ratio in 2025 ([National public service exam sees record-high applicants - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/30/WS674af82ea310f1265a1d064d.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Civil,applicants%20to%20positions%20is%2086%3A1)), whereas a big province like Guangdong had ~10:1 in 2024. That said, certain provinces and cities (especially in affluent or desirable areas) can also see very high competition, and certain provincial jobs can rival or exceed national jobs in applicant ratio (as noted with some exceeding 500:1 ([Focus on the recruitment of civil servants' provincial examinations: the number of applicants in some regions hits a high-中国通讯社](https://china-news-online.com/lang/Canada/4385099.html#:~:text=This%20year%2C%20Chongqing%20plans%20to,is%20as%20high%20as%20548%3A1))). **Candidate overlap:** Many candidates do attempt both exams, so there is a large overlap in the pool – those who fail the Guokao in the fall often double down to take their home province’s exam in spring, for instance. This means top test-takers circulate, and the general competitive caliber might be similar.

- **Hiring and Career Progression:** Once hired, **national civil servants (through Guokao)** are on the state (central) payroll, and their promotion pathways could include moving across ministries or being posted to different provinces as part of a central agency’s regional offices. **Provincial civil servants**, on the other hand, start within the province’s governance framework, typically in local departments, with promotions that could lead to provincial department roles. Switching from provincial to central level (or to another province) later usually requires participation in **公务员遴选或选调** (civil servant transfer or selection exams) after a few years of service. In essence, Guokao can be thought of as joining a national cadre, while Shengkao joins a provincial cadre.

In conclusion, the **national vs. provincial civil service exams are alike in testing format and purpose**, but differ in the jurisdictions and roles they feed into, the scheduling, and the scale of competition. A handy way to remember is: *Guokao = central government jobs across China; Shengkao = jobs in a specific province*. Many ambitious candidates treat the national exam as the first choice due to the allure of central agencies, using the provincial exams as a backup plan or vice versa depending on personal career goals. Regardless, preparation for either exam is quite similar, and success in one does not guarantee success in another, but mastering the content puts one in a good position to try both.
