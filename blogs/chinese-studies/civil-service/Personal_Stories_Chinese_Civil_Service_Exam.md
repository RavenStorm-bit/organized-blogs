Great. I’ll explore Tieba, Xiaohongshu, and other major forums to gather a broad survey of real-life考公stories — from inspiring journeys and study struggles to emotional ups and downs. This will help paint a vivid picture of the考公landscape through the eyes of those living it.

I’ll organize the findings by theme and share representative posts to bring their voices forward.

# Personal Stories of the Chinese Civil Service Exam (考公) Experience

## Introduction  
The pursuit of a civil service job – commonly called **考公** (“kao gong”) in China – has become a way of life for many young people. “考公” literally means *“taking the civil service exam”* but it also symbolizes the *journey* to land a coveted government job. In online communities like Tieba forums, Xiaohongshu (RED), and Zhihu Q&A, thousands of aspiring candidates share **raw personal stories** of triumphs and defeats. They swap advice about daily study routines, vent about repeated failures, celebrate inspirational success stories, and grapple with intense societal pressure. This report surveys a wide range of these first-hand experiences, painting a vivid picture of the考公 journey in modern China. We explore common themes – from uplifting “上岸” (ashore) success stories to gut-wrenching frustrations, from grueling daily routines to emotional post-exam reflections and the “再战” (fight again) mentality – even tales of switching career paths into or out of the考公 race. Throughout, we include quotes and anecdotes (translated to English) straight from user posts, capturing the authentic tone of the community. 

*(“上岸” or “to come ashore” is slang for *succeeding* in passing the exam and getting a job offer, while “下海” or “to go to sea” refers to leaving the stable public sector ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E8%81%8C%E4%B8%9A%E6%8A%89%E6%8B%A9%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%AC%E8%80%83%E5%8F%AA%E6%98%AF%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%80)). These colorful terms reflect how candidates view the civil service as a safe harbor.)*

## 1. **Dreams Realized: Inspirational Success Stories**  
Many posts feature **励志** (inspirational) accounts of people who finally *“made it ashore”* after immense effort. These success stories are held up as proof that perseverance pays off, offering hope to others still in the trenches.

Although she didn’t pass that round, she remained *“not reconciled”* to failure and geared up for the next opportunity ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E6%89%BF%E5%8F%97%E4%BA%86%E5%B7%A8%E5%A4%A7%E7%9A%84%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E%E5%8E%8B%E5%8A%9B%E5%92%8C%E9%AB%98%E5%BA%A6%E7%B4%A7%E5%BC%A0%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%8D%E4%B9%A0%E8%8A%82%E5%A5%8F%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E4%BE%9D%E7%84%B6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E6%8D%A2%E6%9D%A5%E7%90%86%E6%83%B3%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%9C%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%97%E4%B8%8D%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82)). Her resilience finally paid off – she later posted an update joyfully announcing she had *“上岸”* (landed ashore) on attempt number five. *“After so many setbacks, I finally became the ‘child of someone else’s family’ for once,”* she quipped, using a Chinese idiom for the envy-inducing success kid. Her story has inspired countless others to keep trying. 

- **Quick “One-and-Done” Victories:** By contrast, a few rare posts describe *nailing the exam on the first try*, though often coupled with a bit of luck or exceptional preparation. One Zhihu user from an average university recounted how he **juggled campus recruiting and exam prep** in his senior year. He had job offers in hand, but he really wanted to stay in the big city of Shenzhen. *“I realized a stable, secure job would help me gain a footing here,”* he wrote ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E6%A2%81%E7%9B%8A%E8%BE%89%E5%92%8C%E9%9F%A9%E7%AC%91%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%A8%E9%83%BD%E6%98%AF%E2%80%9C%E5%B2%B8%E4%B8%8A%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%E2%80%9D%E3%80%82)).

The result? He beat out hundreds of thousands of competitors in the national exam and *successfully ‘broke through the siege’ of the million-strong exam army to come ashore* ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E4%B8%89%E5%B9%B4%E5%89%8D%EF%BC%8C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E4%B8%B4%E8%BF%91%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%EF%BC%8C%E6%A2%81%E7%9B%8A%E8%BE%89%E6%83%B3%E7%95%99%E5%9C%A8%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E5%9C%A8%E8%BF%99%E4%B9%88%E5%A4%A7%E7%9A%84%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E9%87%8C%E7%AB%8B%E8%B6%B3%EF%BC%8C%E8%8E%B7%E5%BE%97%E4%B8%80%E4%BB%BD%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A%E3%80%81%E6%9C%89%E4%BF%9D%E9%9A%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E5%B8%AE%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E6%89%93%E4%B8%8B%E6%AF%94%E8%BE%83%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E3%80%82)). He became a civil servant right after graduation – an outcome others dream of. 

- **“Never Too Late” Success:** Other success tales come from older candidates or those with winding paths. In one popular story on Tieba, a 30-year-old man managed a dramatic **“counterattack”** on his score and passed after years of failure. He had been an average student (he jokingly called himself a *“third-tier college slacker”*) who struggled in the exam at first. Over several years he honed his study methods and steadily raised his scores, from failing to scoring **top marks** (pen-and-paper score **160+**, ranking top 5 in his province). *“A government job was the best I could hope for, given my background,”* he admitted, *“so I had to go for it early and give it my all”*. His post is full of **study tips** and encouragement for others, proving that an underdog can “逆袭” (make a comeback) with enough dedication. Similarly, another user shared how he *“finally became the pride of the family”* after much struggle – showing that even ordinary people can achieve this goal through grit.

- **Emotional Highs of Success:** Those who do succeed often describe an **emotional high** unlike any other. One user excitedly recounted getting **the call with his results while on a train**. *“My girlfriend phoned me, practically screaming,”* he wrote. *“It’s posted – you got first in the interview! First overall!”* He was so overwhelmed that he *“shot up from my seat and ran to the train’s washroom area, raised my hands above my head like I was in a movie, and applauded myself!”* He laughed at how fellow passengers looked at him like he was crazy. Another successful candidate described walking out of the exam hall and feeling the winter wind on his face, realizing he had topped the rankings. *“The wind never felt so wonderful, everything I saw was pleasing to the eye,”* he wrote – even a cold, blustery day felt like nature’s celebration of his achievement. These heartfelt success posts, full of *tears of joy and disbelief*, serve as shining beacons for those still climbing the mountain.

## 2. **Struggles and Setbacks: Frustration in the Journey**  
For every success story, there are countless posts about **frustration, near-misses, and crushing failure**. It’s common for candidates to fail multiple times, and they openly vent about these painful experiences. Far from rare, *“好几年才上岸是正常现象”* (“taking years to come ashore is normal”) as one article put it. These stories reveal what can go wrong and the emotional toll it takes.

- **Heartbreak of Narrow Defeats:** Many lament *just-missed* opportunities. A well-known example is a young woman from Harbin (widely reported by Chinese media) who failed **four years in a row by the slimmest of margins** ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E5%85%AC%E8%80%834%E6%AC%A1%EF%BC%9A%E9%99%A4%E4%BA%86%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E6%B2%A1%E6%83%B3%E8%BF%87%E5%88%AB%E7%9A%84)).

It’s a vivid illustration of how a near-victory can feel even more heartbreaking than an outright failure. Another user described a similar experience: *“I was second in the written exam, but got bumped in the interview – missed by 0.1 points!”* He initially fumed that if only he had chosen a different post, he would have been first ([考公务员好几年都没上岸是什么体验？_岗位](https://www.sohu.com/a/474874198_100083027#:~:text=%E8%B7%9F%E4%BD%A0%E8%AF%B4%E4%B8%AA%E5%B0%8F%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B%E3%80%82%E6%88%91%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%AA%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%9B%BE%E7%BB%8F%E5%85%A8%E8%81%8C%E5%9C%A8%E5%AE%B6%E5%A4%87%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E9%95%BF%E8%BE%BE%E5%9B%9B%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%8C%E5%89%8D%E6%8F%90%E6%98%AF%E4%BB%96%E7%9A%84%E7%88%B6%E6%AF%8D%E5%85%A8%E5%8A%9B%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%EF%BC%8C%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E7%BB%99%E4%BB%96%E4%BB%BB%E4%BD%95%E5%8E%8B%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%82%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%8C%E7%AC%94%E8%AF%95%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9%E4%B8%8D%E9%AB%98%E8%A2%AB%E6%B7%98%E6%B1%B0%EF%BC%8C%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E5%B9%B4%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E8%BF%9B%E5%85%A5%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%EF%BC%8C%E7%AC%AC%20%E4%B8%89%E5%B9%B4%E4%BE%9D%E7%84%B6%E7%AC%94%E8%AF%95%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%E8%A2%AB%E6%B7%98%E6%B1%B0%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E5%90%8C%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%B9%B4%E7%BB%BC%E5%90%88%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9%E5%B7%AE%E4%BA%86%E5%A5%BD%E5%87%A0%E5%88%86%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E5%B9%B4%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E5%8F%AA%E5%B7%AE%E4%BA%860)).

- **Multiple Failures and “陪跑” (Also-Ran) Life:** A common term in these forums is **“陪跑”**, meaning *to run alongside*, describing people who keep taking exams but never clinch a spot (always the bridesmaid, never the bride). One contributor, nicknamed “浣熊” (Raccoon), shared his experience of **failing repeatedly for a full year**. He had actually **quit his job to go all-in** on exam prep (becoming what’s jokingly called an “啃老族”, someone living off their parents). With his mother’s financial and emotional support, he studied full-time. Even so, he kept bombing exam after exam. *“I’d check my results and think, oh, failed again. I became **numb** to it,”* he admitted. Relatives questioned whether he was wasting his life, and at times he began to **doubt himself**. *“I had zero confidence left for the next test,”* he wrote, *“because I was so used to failing. I was afraid that if I got my hopes up, I’d slack off, so better to stay numb.”* It took **stumbling through many dark moments** and **breaking through countless mental bottlenecks**, but eventually he did pass (in his second year). He posted to encourage others: *“Only each of us knows the pain we’ve endured inside. But if you keep picking yourself up, one day you’ll ‘see the moon after the clouds’ (守得云开见月明) – the sky will clear and you’ll see the light.”* 

- **Emotional and Mental Health Strains:** The *考公* grind can exact a serious mental toll. Extreme examples include a tragic story that went viral: a **33-year-old woman** in Xi’an who had been preparing for civil service for years was found to have died alone in her rental apartment. She had *no job and had been studying for a decade*, and reports say she essentially **starved** after running out of money. Her story shocked online communities – many asked, *“Why didn’t she stop after 10 years of failure?”* and *“How could a college grad not find any job to sustain herself?”*. It sparked heated debate about the **risks of being “all-in” on考公** with no backup plan. More commonly, users talk about **depression, anxiety, and burnout**. *“Year after year of study, failure, then study again, then fail again – the blows are really hard to take,”* one seasoned exam taker wrote. Some describe feeling worthless or embarrassed around successful peers. In one post, a user admitted she *“shut herself at home and couldn’t bear to see classmates, because they all had jobs and I was still unemployed, chasing this dream”*. 

- **Family and Social Pressure:** A recurring theme is **intense pressure from family** – sometimes supportive, sometimes suffocating. One alarming story describes a young woman in Sichuan literally **“driven crazy”** by her parents’ pressure ([女子考公失败被逼疯，那些35岁还没考上公务员的人，后来怎样了_手机新浪网](http://tt.sina.cn/article_2309404916626515690823.html?cre=tianyi&mod=wapwbsx&loc=4&r=25&rfunc=31&tj=cxvertical_wapwbsx&tr=0&wm=3049_0105#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E6%BB%9A%E5%BC%80%EF%BC%81%E6%88%91%E6%98%AF%E5%B1%80%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%A0%E4%BB%AC%E8%B0%81%E9%83%BD%E7%AE%A1%E4%B8%8D%E7%9D%80%E6%88%91%EF%BC%8C%E7%AE%A1%E4%B8%8D%E7%9D%80%E6%88%91%EF%BC%81%E2%80%9D)). *“Get out!

This girl (nicknamed *“Little Yang”*) had **graduated with a mediocre degree** and hadn’t found a job; her working-class parents **forced her to stay home and do nothing but study** for the civil service exam ([女子考公失败被逼疯，那些35岁还没考上公务员的人，后来怎样了_手机新浪网](http://tt.sina.cn/article_2309404916626515690823.html?cre=tianyi&mod=wapwbsx&loc=4&r=25&rfunc=31&tj=cxvertical_wapwbsx&tr=0&wm=3049_0105#:~:text=%E8%BF%99%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E8%A2%AB%E2%80%9C%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E2%80%9D%E9%80%BC%E7%96%AF%E7%9A%84%E5%A7%91%E5%A8%98%E3%80%82)). They wouldn’t even let her go outside, treating her *“like a prisoner”*, because they desperately wanted her to *“jump the dragon gate”* (a metaphor for rising to success) with a government job ([女子考公失败被逼疯，那些35岁还没考上公务员的人，后来怎样了_手机新浪网](http://tt.sina.cn/article_2309404916626515690823.html?cre=tianyi&mod=wapwbsx&loc=4&r=25&rfunc=31&tj=cxvertical_wapwbsx&tr=0&wm=3049_0105#:~:text=%E5%9B%9B%E5%B7%9D%E5%A7%91%E5%A8%98%E5%B0%8F%E9%98%B3%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E4%BA%8E%E6%9F%90%E2%80%9C%E5%8F%8C%E9%9D%9E%E2%80%9D%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E6%B3%95%E5%BE%8B%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E5%90%8E%E4%B8%80%E7%9B%B4%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E6%89%BE%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%8C%E8%A2%AB%E7%88%B6%E6%AF%8D%E9%80%BC%E7%9D%80%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%82)). After **five years of failing**, she developed severe depression and schizophrenia ([女子考公失败被逼疯，那些35岁还没考上公务员的人，后来怎样了_手机新浪网](http://tt.sina.cn/article_2309404916626515690823.html?cre=tianyi&mod=wapwbsx&loc=4&r=25&rfunc=31&tj=cxvertical_wapwbsx&tr=0&wm=3049_0105#:~:text=%E5%9B%9B%E5%B7%9D%E5%A7%91%E5%A8%98%E5%B0%8F%E9%98%B3%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E4%BA%8E%E6%9F%90%E2%80%9C%E5%8F%8C%E9%9D%9E%E2%80%9D%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E6%B3%95%E5%BE%8B%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E5%90%8E%E4%B8%80%E7%9B%B4%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E6%89%BE%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%8C%E8%A2%AB%E7%88%B6%E6%AF%8D%E9%80%BC%E7%9D%80%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%82)). Even then, her mother coldly called her *“useless”*, still fixated on the fact that she hadn’t passed. This extreme case is fortunately rare, but **smaller-scale family pressure** is very common. Parents often view a civil service job as the only respectable path and can impose ultimatums. *“My mom says if I don’t pass this year, I must go get *any* job,”* one user wrote. Others are motivated by family needs: a few married posters mentioned they were *“fighting to pass so I can finally marry my girlfriend”* or to make their parents proud. Community members empathize with each other on these pressures. They sometimes role-play conversations persuading stubborn parents that *考公* isn’t the **only** way – or bonding over the fact that *“Chinese parents just don’t get it”* when it comes to mental health. 

- **“老大哥, 大姐” – Aging Candidates:** Because of these repeated failures, some candidates push right up against the age limit (many civil service posts cap eligibility at 35 years old). In discussions, you’ll often find people in their 30s calling themselves *“公考老将”* (veterans of the exam war) or *调侃* (self-deprecatingly joking) about being *“大龄考生”* (over-age examinees). For example, a **34-year-old full-time mom** named Ke Ping shared her struggle of preparing for exams while raising children. She had spent four years and *“almost every attempt was a failure”*, even though she did manage to get into one interview round. She kept at it despite juggling **breastfeeding, chores, and marital friction** (her husband gradually lost patience with her study efforts). In one mock exam, the stress finally broke her: she was still nursing her baby and **started lactating painfully during the test**. *“I was sweating and in pain, couldn’t focus,”* she wrote. A younger examinee next to her kindly whispered that maybe *“you shouldn’t push yourself so hard, perhaps exams just aren’t for you anymore”*. *“Not suited for this”* – that comment *“stabbed me in the heart,”* Ke Ping recalled. She ran out of the exam hall to pump breast milk in the bathroom, tears streaming down her face with feelings of defeat. Online, people expressed huge sympathy for her. *“So tough…being a mom and still chasing this,”* one comment read. These accounts shed light on the **hidden struggles** older candidates face: declining support from spouses, feeling *“my brain isn’t as sharp anymore”*, and the looming cutoff age that forces a *now-or-never* mentality. 

Despite all these frustrations, a key message in the community is that **failure is not the end**. One popular Zhihu answer reminds readers: *“In public exams, failure isn’t something only a tiny minority experiences – it’s actually very common. You are not alone, so don’t give up”*. This reassurance – that struggling through multiple failures is *normal* – helps many keep their motivation alive. 

## 3. **Behind the Scenes: Daily Routines and Lifestyle During Prep**  
Preparing for the civil service exam is often described as a **lifestyle in itself**. Candidates swap details of their daily schedules, study methods, and how they balance life and exam prep. From full-time studying shut-ins to office workers squeezing in study time, the routines vary, but **discipline** is a common thread.

- **Full-Time Prep Schedules:** Those who can afford to, often **study full-time** for months or even years. A typical day often starts early and ends late. *“Up by 7:30, at my desk by 8,”* one user writes in a daily log on Xiaohongshu. *“I study in blocks until lunch, then again in the afternoon and evening. By 11 pm I wrap up, and it’s lights out at midnight.”* Attending intensive **封闭班 (closed bootcamps)** is also popular – like 53-day camps where students live in a dorm and do nothing but study under instructors’ guidance. In one success story, a candidate described her bootcamp routine: *“Class or study from 8:30 in the morning straight through 11 at night – I didn’t dare slack off a minute”* ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E4%B8%BA%E4%BA%86%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E7%AC%AC%E5%9B%9B%E6%AC%A1%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%EF%BC%8C%E5%AE%B6%E9%87%8C%E8%8A%B1%E4%BA%863%E4%B8%87%E5%A4%9A%E9%80%81%E5%A5%B9%E5%8F%82%E5%8A%A0%E4%BA%86%E5%85%AC%E5%9F%B9%E6%9C%BA%E6%9E%8453%E5%A4%A9%E7%9A%84%E5%B0%81%E9%97%AD%E5%BC%8F%E5%9F%B9%E8%AE%AD%E7%8F%AD%E3%80%82%E4%B8%B4%E8%A1%8C%E5%89%8D%EF%BC%8C%E5%A6%88%E5%A6%88%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%9A%E2%80%9C%E8%BF%99%E6%98%AF%E4%BD%A0%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%98%E8%80%83%E4%B8%8D%E4%B8%8A%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%9D%E5%B0%B1%E5%88%AB%E5%86%8D%E7%BB%99%E6%88%91%E8%80%83%E4%BA%86%EF%BC%81%E2%80%9D%E5%B8%A6%E7%9D%80%E5%8E%8B%E5%8A%9B%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%8E%E6%AF%8F%E5%A4%A9%E6%97%A9%20%E4%B8%8A8%EF%BC%9A30%E5%88%B0%E6%99%9A%E4%B8%8A11%E7%82%B9%EF%BC%8C%E5%BC%A0%E7%8F%82%E7%84%B6%E4%B8%8D%E6%95%A2%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%9D%E6%9D%BE%E6%87%88%EF%BC%8C%E5%A4%9C%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E5%AF%90%E3%80%82)). Such environments take over one’s life: even meals and short breaks are scheduled. Some forum users joke that they *“live like monks or machines”* during the prep period – cut off from social media, no dating, minimal entertainment – all to maintain focus. 

- **“啃老” at the Study Desk:** A number of posts come from fresh graduates who moved back home to study, supported by parents (hence the term **啃老族**, living off one’s folks). They often express gratitude for this opportunity. *“I quit my job and curled up at home to study – became a proper ‘啃老’ youth,”* one user admits frankly. *“Thank goodness for my mom; she gave me a warm harbor so I had no worries except studying.”* At home, they try to keep a strict routine. For example, one poster’s **daily schedule** went viral for its rigor: **6:30am wake-up**, quick breakfast, study from 7:00 till noon (with maybe a 10-minute break each hour), a short nap after lunch, then study again from 2:00pm to 6:00pm, quick dinner, and more practice questions from 7:30pm until around 11:00pm. She allotted specific time for different subjects: e.g. *“morning for quantitative and logic drills, afternoon for essay writing practice.”* Such timetables are shared to help others organize their day. However, many caution that **quality beats quantity**. *“Don’t blindly aim for 12 hours a day from the start,”* an experienced user advises newbies. *“Ramp up gradually from 8 to 10 to 12 hours. Otherwise you’ll burn out – I’ve seen people emotionally break down after forcing themselves too hard.”* Efficiency and consistency matter more than sheer hours, as many successful candidates note.

- **Balancing Work and Prep:** Not everyone can study full-time; lots of posts come from **在职考公** – people preparing while working a day job. Their lifestyle is a **balancing act** between job duties and study sessions. A common strategy is using every *“碎片时间”* (fragment of free time). *“I’d sneak in practice questions during lunch breaks,”* one user working in a factory shared. *“After clocking out at 6 pm, I hit the books by 7 and push through till maybe 11 pm.”* Another office worker mapped out his weekday routine: *“No matter how tired after work, guarantee at least 3 hours study each night”*. He would get home by 6:30, do a quick workout or shower to refresh, then study from 7pm to 10pm daily. On weekends, he’d ramp up to 8+ hours of study. Many admit it’s **exhausting**: *“Honestly, some nights I’m so tired I don’t want to move,”* one poster wrote. The community often chimes in with encouragement and tips: for instance, suggesting study **groups after work** to keep each other accountable, or reminding them to **take power naps** to recharge. There’s also debate on whether to **quit your job to study** – some, like a user named Kang Rui, tried to work and “巡考” (take exams in many places) at first, but eventually **decided to resign and focus full-time**. *“My day job was suffering, and I figured I could survive a year on savings; surely I’d pass by then,”* he reasoned. However, after he quit, it still took him three more years and even then he had to turn down one offer due to location and another due to cost of living. His advice in hindsight: *“If you can manage, keep your job while studying. Quitting adds financial stress that you don’t need on top of exam stress.”*

- **Study Techniques and Habits:** Daily life during考公 prep isn’t all about hours; *how* people study is a hot topic too. Candidates on Zhihu and Tieba eagerly share their methods – making **错题本 (error notebooks)** to track mistakes, using flashcards for common knowledge, timing themselves on practice tests, etc. Many describe starting the day with reading **时政热点** (current political news and articles, since policy and current affairs are commonly tested). Some even incorporate physical exercise into their routine to keep a clear mind. *“I run 3 kilometers every evening to manage stress,”* one user posted in a lifestyle thread. Others talk about diet: avoiding heavy foods that make them sluggish, and carrying coffee or tea into long study sessions. A bit of dark humor pops up too – like the running joke that *“考公人”* survive on **“鸡汤”** (chicken soup) – not the food, but motivational platitudes. People will post inspirational quotes or success images captioned *“天天打鸡血”* (pumping myself up every day) as a way to keep going. It’s both sincere and tongue-in-cheek. The community has even invented a term **“公考养生”** – meaning trying to stay healthy during the intense prep (sleeping enough, not wrecking your body), because burnout is a real concern. 

In sum, the lifestyle of a 考公 candidate often revolves around **rigid self-discipline**, whether they’re cloistered at home, in a training academy, or juggling a day job. They turn studying into a full-time job itself. Their posts paint a picture of long hours at the desk, sacrifices in social life, and creative strategies to maximize learning. As one veteran summed up: *“It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Make a realistic schedule you can stick to. Persistence is what wins in the end.”*

## 4. **After the Exam: Reflections, Emotions, and the “再战” Mindset**  
When the exam (or interview) is over and results come out, candidates flood forums with their **post-exam reflections**. Whether it’s joy, relief, disappointment, or determination, they share those raw emotions – and crucially, they discuss what’s next. A common phrase is **“明年再战”** – *“we’ll battle again next year.”* This section explores how people process their results and how the community responds.

- **Elation and Reality Checks:** For those who passed, the immediate reaction is euphoria, but some also experience a sobering reality later. One fresh graduate who passed described his initial feelings: *“First thought: finally, I have a secure job, I can put my heart back in my chest and go have fun!”*. *“Second thought: I was a bit full of myself – passing is special, I’m now one of the ‘public rice bowl’ people, especially since I got into a provincial-level agency, quite proud.”* But then came the first month’s paycheck. *“It was like a cold water bucket over my head – **so little money!**”* he wrote, *“My heart sank…only then did I realize, at the grassroots level, civil servants are basically a weak group – lots of work, low pay.”* Three years into the job, he confessed he sometimes wondered if he made the right choice, *“occasionally regretting not pursuing something else”*. This kind of reflection is not uncommon: people celebrate “上岸” as a victory, but later share a more nuanced view that the job itself has challenges (lower salary, high workloads, etc.). Still, most are grateful for the stability. As one successful poster put it: *“Sure, I won’t get rich as a low-level civil servant, but it secures my basic life. I won’t starve, and that peace of mind is worth it.”* ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E7%8B%AC%E7%94%9F%E5%A5%B3%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E4%B8%8D%E6%83%B3%E7%A6%BB%E5%AE%B6%E5%A4%AA%E8%BF%9C%EF%BC%8C%E7%94%A8%E5%A5%B9%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%9D%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E7%9A%84%E2%80%9C%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A%E2%80%9D%E5%92%8C%E2%80%9C%E6%9C%89%E4%BF%9D%E9%9A%9C%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E8%83%BD%E7%BB%99%E4%BA%88%E5%A5%B9%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E6%84%9F%E3%80%82))

- **Crushing Disappointments:** For those who fail (which is the majority, given the odds), post-exam discussions revolve around coping and analyzing what went wrong. Many describe the emotional low point candidly. *“I felt I had no face to see my folks,”* one user wrote after failing the interview stage, *“功亏一篑，无颜面对江东父老”* – a dramatic Chinese idiom meaning *“to fail at the last step, I have no face to face my elders”*. Another admitted, *“When the results came, my heart went straight to the bottom”*, especially after months of hard work. People talk about crying, feeling numb, or even envying those who passed. However, after the initial wave of grief, many posts shift to a tone of **“moving forward”**. This is where **“再战” (fight again)** comes in. It’s common to see users end a post with something like, *“总结经验，收拾心情，准备再战!”* – *“Summing up lessons, picking myself up, and getting ready to fight again!”* The community often rallies around these posters, replying with encouragement: *“加油！明年再来”* (Cheer up, come back next year), or sharing their own past failures to show that perseverance can eventually lead to success. 

- **Lessons Learned and Advice:** After exams, candidates also analyze their performance in almost forensic detail. They’ll discuss which sections they messed up (e.g. *“I panicked on the math questions and wasted too much time”* or *“My essay thesis wasn’t strong enough”*), as well as strategies to improve. These debrief posts serve as both therapy and practical advice. One user, after failing multiple times, wrote a long Zhihu answer on how **luck and strategy** play roles: *“I realized 公考 is about strength **and** luck. It’s not that studying longer guarantees a higher score. Sometimes the competition is just tough or the slot is too tight. The moment you can calmly accept that, congratulations – you’ve become a real ‘公考 veteran’.”* His point was that adjusting one’s mindset from *expecting* success to just doing one’s best and letting fate decide can make the process less agonizing. Others give concrete tips for the next round: choosing less competitive positions to improve odds, focusing on one’s weakest subject, or improving interview skills. It’s common to see comments like *“I scored low in the logic section, so I’m going to drill that hard for the next few months.”* In this way, the **community functions like a support group and study workshop**, helping members channel their disappointment into actionable plans.

- **The “再战” Spirit:** The phrase “再战” (battle again) itself reflects a kind of **dogged optimism**. It’s almost a badge of honor among repeat takers. One inspiring story that circulated was about a guy who took the exam **six years in a row**, finally passing at age 35 – literally at the last age of eligibility. He jokingly called himself *“catching the last bus”* and noted how most people around him passed in 2-3 tries, but *“I walked this path for six years”*. His persistence paid off in the end, and he wanted others to know that **not giving up** is crucial. Similarly, the young woman from Harbin mentioned earlier, despite her four consecutive failures and emotional breakdown, famously decided to try a fifth time ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E6%89%BF%E5%8F%97%E4%BA%86%E5%B7%A8%E5%A4%A7%E7%9A%84%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E%E5%8E%8B%E5%8A%9B%E5%92%8C%E9%AB%98%E5%BA%A6%E7%B4%A7%E5%BC%A0%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%8D%E4%B9%A0%E8%8A%82%E5%A5%8F%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E4%BE%9D%E7%84%B6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E6%8D%A2%E6%9D%A5%E7%90%86%E6%83%B3%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%9C%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%97%E4%B8%8D%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82)). *“She still wasn’t willing to accept defeat,”* the news article noted ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E6%89%BF%E5%8F%97%E4%BA%86%E5%B7%A8%E5%A4%A7%E7%9A%84%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E%E5%8E%8B%E5%8A%9B%E5%92%8C%E9%AB%98%E5%BA%A6%E7%B4%A7%E5%BC%A0%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%8D%E4%B9%A0%E8%8A%82%E5%A5%8F%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E4%BE%9D%E7%84%B6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E6%8D%A2%E6%9D%A5%E7%90%86%E6%83%B3%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%9C%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%97%E4%B8%8D%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82)). This relentless spirit is celebrated in the forums. When someone posts about giving up, others often remind them of stories like these. At the same time, community members are realistic and empathetic: they emphasize **mental health** and taking breaks if needed. *“休息也是为了更好的再战”* – *“Resting is also for the sake of fighting again better,”* one user wrote to a discouraged peer. There is a shared understanding that this exam can be a long war of attrition, and stamina matters.

- **Post “上岸” Reflections:** Interestingly, even those who succeed and join the civil service often remain active in these communities, sharing a different perspective: what life is like *after* “coming ashore.” Some confess that they initially felt *lost* or *“空落落”* (empty) once the intense exam chase was over. One person wrote, *“After two years focused solely on考公, when I finally made it, my heart felt kind of hollow. I suddenly didn’t know what to do with myself.”* It’s as if the journey defined them for so long that reaching the destination left a void. They advise current examinees to have hobbies or other goals so that life isn’t 100% defined by考公. Others provide a reality check about the job: *“Be prepared: the salary might disappoint you, and work can be mundane or stressful.”* These return visitors to the forum often become **mentors**, warning against overly idealizing the job and encouraging folks to pursue it with clear eyes. They add a bittersweet note to the narrative: success is wonderful, but it’s not the end of one’s challenges.

In summary, the moments after exam results bring **catharsis** to the考公 community – whether that’s joy or sorrow. It’s a time of reflection, learning, and re-energizing for the next battle. The dominant tone is *supportive*: users cheer each other on to persevere, but also remind each other to stay sane and keep perspective. The phrase *“公考不易，坚持的你也很了不起”* often appears – *“Civil service exams aren’t easy, and the fact you’re persisting makes you awesome too.”* It encapsulates the community spirit that even those still fighting are worthy of respect for their effort.

## 5. **Changing Course: Stories of Switching Paths**  
Not everyone’s journey is a straight line toward考公. In the forums, we also encounter people who **switch paths** – some who pivot *into* civil service after other pursuits, and others who *leave* the考公 path for something else. These stories highlight the crossroads many face: **考研 (grad school) vs. 考公**, private sector vs. public sector, or even choosing happiness over societal expectations.

- **From Grad School Aspirant to Civil Servant:** A common scenario is someone failing the **考研** (postgraduate entrance exam) and then deciding to try考公 instead. For instance, a Zhihu user named Han Xiao shared that he **failed his graduate exam** and upon graduating college he had *“no clear career plan”* ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E5%92%8C%E6%A2%81%E7%9B%8A%E8%BE%89%E7%9B%B8%E6%AF%94%EF%BC%8C%E9%9F%A9%E7%AC%91%E5%BD%93%E5%B9%B4%E7%9A%84%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E5%AD%A3%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%9B%E8%BF%B7%E8%8C%AB%E3%80%82)). He drifted through **five different jobs in five years** after college, never satisfied. *“I was just going with the flow, sending resumes everywhere,”* he said ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E5%92%8C%E6%A2%81%E7%9B%8A%E8%BE%89%E7%9B%B8%E6%AF%94%EF%BC%8C%E9%9F%A9%E7%AC%91%E5%BD%93%E5%B9%B4%E7%9A%84%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E5%AD%A3%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%9B%E8%BF%B7%E8%8C%AB%E3%80%82)). Over those years, he watched peers settle into careers, and he felt a growing sense of *aimlessness*. Eventually, he decided to focus on the civil service exam. His journey was epic: *“I traveled across nearly 10 cities, took 22 exams in total,”* he wrote ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E4%B9%8B%E5%89%8D%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E9%83%BD%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E6%88%91%E6%83%B3%E8%A6%81%E7%9A%84%E7%8A%B6%E6%80%81%EF%BC%8C%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%B7%E5%80%BC%E6%84%9F%EF%BC%8C%E2%80%9D%E9%9F%A9%E7%AC%91%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E7%94%98%E5%BF%83%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E5%B0%B1%E8%BF%99%E4%B9%88%E6%B7%B7%E4%B8%8B%E5%8E%BB%E3%80%82)). He was so eager to “come ashore” that he *“even took an exam for a highway toll collector position”* at one point!

In forums, you’ll see questions like *“考研失败，要不要转战考公？”* and a lot of people responding that it’s a viable plan B, with some even suggesting that having a master’s degree later can help promotion *within* the civil service. 

- **From Corporate Grind to “体制内”:** Another trend is young professionals from the private sector deciding to leave and pursue考公. On social media, phrases like **“宇宙的尽头是考公”** (“the end of the universe is civil service”) have become a meme – joking that no matter where you start (even as a high-paid tech worker), eventually many end up trying for the government job. One widely shared example was **Zhao Yang**, a programmer from a big tech firm (a “大厂” job) who quit his job to prepare for the civil service exam. He candidly wrote about his experience: *“I went in overconfident. I thought with my elite background I’d ace it easily. But when I sat in that exam hall, I was staring at the questions with a head full of fog. I sweated like crazy and barely understood what was being asked.”* He failed both the national and provincial exams on that first try. *“It was **too hard**,”* he admitted, *“I had totally underestimated it.”* That was a wake-up call. *“From that moment, I put away my fluke mind and decided to give it my all, no looking back, until I pass,”* he declared. His post encapsulates a common sentiment: people leaving high-pressure corporate jobs in search of a more secure or meaningful life, only to realize **考公 is its own difficult battlefield** requiring specialized preparation. Many *科技圈* (tech circle) folks discuss how the skills for coding or engineering don’t translate to the civil service exam, which tests law, public policy, logic, language, etc. Still, the allure of a government job – often cited are *better work-life balance, job security, and social status* – drives them to make this switch. There are numerous “程序员考公” (programmer takes civil service exam) stories on Zhihu, essentially modern “围城” tales (the idea that people in one camp want to escape to the other side of the “castle walls” and vice versa). For example, one former tech worker wrote: *“In 2020, 1.5 million grads applied to ByteDance for 3k jobs (50:1 odds). In 2021, 2 million people took the national civil service exam for 30k jobs (59:1 odds). Both paths are crazy competitive – pick your poison!”* But despite the competition, posts from ex-corporate folks often express that they’d prefer the civil servant route for long-term life stability.

- **Giving Up考公 (转行 or Quit):** On the flip side, some realize this path isn’t for them and decide to **leave the 考公 race** – their voices are also present, sometimes as cautionary tales. The Sohu article *“I Gave Up考公考编 and Changed My Destiny”* is one such first-person story. The author, a young woman from a poor rural family, initially *considered* going for civil service or further studies like everyone else, but her economic situation didn’t allow it. *“Honestly, I was too poor to afford failing,”* she wrote bluntly. *“Who would pay for those years of living if I went down that path?*” She had struggled even to pay her college tuition, and by senior year she was practically penniless. Seeing a news story about another girl who died after 10 years of failed exam attempts triggered her to reflect. *“I realized the best choice I made after graduation was **not** joining the考公考编 herd,”* she said. Instead, she went straight to work – moving to Beijing, hustling through dozens of job interviews despite facing *“naked discrimination for not being from a prestigious school”*. It wasn’t easy (she recounts humiliating interviews where companies openly told her *“we only hire Tsinghua/Harvard types”*), but eventually she found a job and built a career. She wrote this story to highlight that **考公 isn’t the only way out**, and in fact, for someone without financial backup, it can be *“an extremely risky bet”*. Her mantra became: *“直接就业更实际，贫穷让我放弃考公考研，但我不后悔”* – *“Going straight to work was the right call; being poor made me give up exams, but I have no regrets.”*. This perspective is eye-opening in forums often dominated by考公 fever. It reminds readers that everyone’s situation is different. Some replies thanked her for telling a different kind of success story – one not about passing an exam, but about forging a life through another route.

- **Mid-Course Adjustments:** There are also those who start on the考公 road and then adjust their goals. For example, remember the Harbin girl, 滕雪, who refused a small-city job and kept trying for Harbin? After years of effort and failing to get a Harbin civil servant spot (her scores were good but competition was fiercer once she lost “fresh grad” status), she had a revelation: *maybe a stable job that’s not a formal公务员 could be okay*. She lowered her target and took exams for **社区工作者** (community worker) positions. In 2020, she succeeded – landing a community job in Harbin. *“The pay and status aren’t as good as a civil servant,”* she noted, *“but I’m really happy with it. I got to stay in Harbin, and it’s a stable job – for me, after five years, that’s the best outcome.”* She then got married and settled down, feeling content. This kind of pivot – aiming for *事业单位* or local community roles instead of the higher-status公务员 – is something people discuss as Plan B. Similarly, some who repeatedly fail national exams decide to focus on **省考** (provincial exams) or **事业编** (public institution exams) which can be slightly less competitive. The community generally supports these pragmatic shifts. There is a recognition that *“上岸不一定要上公务员的岸”* – *“coming ashore doesn’t have to mean a civil servant job specifically”* – if you land a stable public-sector job of some kind, that can be a win too.

Overall, the switching-path stories add depth to the考公 narrative: they reveal **why people are drawn in or drawn out**. Common motivations for switching **into** 考公 include disillusionment with the private sector rat race, desire for stability especially after major events (like COVID economic impacts), or simply maturing and realizing a stable life is preferable to youthful ambitions. Motivations for switching **away** or quitting include financial pressure, mental health, discovering other passions, or aging out. A trend in recent years, as noted by media, is that **the考公 craze is partly fueled by external pressures**: *“The past three years knocked down countless companies and left many workers jobless; people grew anxious about their future and turned to the reliable path of public service.”* So we see programmers, MBAs, even PhD holders joining the fray for a government job, while a few individuals buck the trend and find success elsewhere. 

In the forums, these discussions foster an understanding that 考公 is *a choice, not destiny*. As one person eloquently put it: *“人生没有哪条路一定对。考公也好，工作也好，读研也好，关键是找到适合自己的路。”* – *“There’s no single ‘right’ path in life. Be it civil service, private job, or grad school, the key is finding what suits you.”* The diverse stories shared online help illustrate that philosophy.

## 6. **Trends and Community Themes in考公 Discussions**  
Zooming out, a few **big-picture themes** emerge from these myriad personal stories. The考公 communities of 2023-2025 reflect not just individual journeys, but also the **zeitgeist** of Chinese youth facing a tough job market and shifting values. Here are some notable trends and common threads:

- **“考公热” – The Civil Service Craze:** There’s no doubt that *考公* has become something of a craze in recent years. Year after year, record numbers of people sign up. In forums, users frequently cite statistics: for example, *“This year nearly 2.6 million people applied for the national exam, fighting for 37,000 posts – that’s about 70 people competing for each spot on average!”*. In some extreme cases, they mention, it’s *“hundreds or even thousands to one”* for certain coveted positions. These numbers, while daunting, are strangely bonding – everyone knows they’re in a *giant boat* together. The phrase **“千军万马过独木桥”** – *“a thousand troops charging over a single-log bridge”* – is often used to describe the exam’s competitiveness. So why are so many people flocking to考公? The stories above give clues: **economic uncertainty** (layoffs, gig economy instability), a cultural premium on **稳定 (stability)**, and the appeal of a respectable, lifelong career. One media piece noted: *“Amid a bleak economy, many young people see civil service as the best way to **逆天改命** (defy fate and change their destiny)”*. Forum conversations reflect this: users mention how even top university grads are joining the civil service queues, and there’s talk of *“宇宙尽头是考公”* meme as mentioned. It’s become mainstream to consider this path – a big change from a decade ago, when private sector or entrepreneurship were more glamorized. As one user wryly noted, *“Arrogant as we once were, we no longer sneer at考公. We don’t even need our parents to nag us; we pick up the books ourselves now”*. This signals a generational shift – a sort of pragmatic turn among youth.

- **Motivations: Security, Fairness, and Family:** Digging into posts about *why* people choose考公, a few keywords pop up repeatedly. **“稳定” (stability)** is number one – the allure of a secure job with a baseline income that’s *“旱涝保收”* (safe in drought or flood) ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99%E5%9B%BE%EF%BC%9A%E8%80%83%E7%94%9F%E5%9C%A8%E5%AF%BB%E6%89%BE%E8%80%83%E5%9C%BA%E3%80%82%E5%BC%A0%E6%96%8C%20%E6%91%84)). A civil servant’s salary may not be high, but it’s reliable, and benefits like healthcare, pension, housing fund, etc., provide a safety net that many jobs lack. **“公平” (fairness)** is another factor some mention ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=4%E5%B9%B4%E7%9A%84%E5%85%AC%E8%80%83%E5%BE%81%E9%80%94%EF%BC%8C%E7%A6%BB%E4%B8%8D%E5%BC%80%E5%AE%B6%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E3%80%82%E4%BB%8E%E5%A4%A7%E5%9B%9B%E5%81%9A%E5%87%BA%E5%85%AC%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84%E5%86%B3%E5%AE%9A%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%EF%BC%8C%E7%88%B7%E7%88%B7%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%E5%BC%A0%E7%8F%82%E7%84%B6%E6%9C%80%E5%9D%9A%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%80%85%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%99%E4%BD%8D%E5%B7%B2%E7%BB%8F%E9%80%80%E4%BC%91%E7%9A%84%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E5%AF%B9%E4%BD%93%E5%88%B6%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%86%E8%A7%A3%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E7%AB%9F%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E6%9C%89%E6%AF%94%E8%BE%83%E4%BD%93%E9%9D%A2%E7%9A%84%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E5%9C%B0%E4%BD%8D%20%EF%BC%8C%E5%9C%A8%E8%80%81%E5%AE%B6%E4%BA%BA%E7%9C%BC%E9%87%8C%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%AC%E8%81%8C%E4%BA%BA%E5%91%98%E6%98%AF%E5%90%83%E2%80%9C%E7%9A%87%E7%B2%AE%E2%80%9D%E7%9A%84%EF%BC%8C%E6%97%B1%E6%B6%9D%E4%BF%9D%E6%94%B6%E3%80%82)). University grads who aren’t from elite schools feel that the civil service exam is a more meritocratic playing field compared to job hunting where pedigree and connections often matter. *“The selection process is standardized and fairer – it doesn’t matter if you went to a normal school like me,”* said the Harbin candidate Zhang Keran ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=4%E5%B9%B4%E7%9A%84%E5%85%AC%E8%80%83%E5%BE%81%E9%80%94%EF%BC%8C%E7%A6%BB%E4%B8%8D%E5%BC%80%E5%AE%B6%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E3%80%82%E4%BB%8E%E5%A4%A7%E5%9B%9B%E5%81%9A%E5%87%BA%E5%85%AC%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84%E5%86%B3%E5%AE%9A%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%EF%BC%8C%E7%88%B7%E7%88%B7%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%E5%BC%A0%E7%8F%82%E7%84%B6%E6%9C%80%E5%9D%9A%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%80%85%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%99%E4%BD%8D%E5%B7%B2%E7%BB%8F%E9%80%80%E4%BC%91%E7%9A%84%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E5%AF%B9%E4%BD%93%E5%88%B6%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%86%E8%A7%A3%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E7%AB%9F%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E6%9C%89%E6%AF%94%E8%BE%83%E4%BD%93%E9%9D%A2%E7%9A%84%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E5%9C%B0%E4%BD%8D%20%EF%BC%8C%E5%9C%A8%E8%80%81%E5%AE%B6%E4%BA%BA%E7%9C%BC%E9%87%8C%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%AC%E8%81%8C%E4%BA%BA%E5%91%98%E6%98%AF%E5%90%83%E2%80%9C%E7%9A%87%E7%B2%AE%E2%80%9D%E7%9A%84%EF%BC%8C%E6%97%B1%E6%B6%9D%E4%BF%9D%E6%94%B6%E3%80%82)). Passing the exam gave her a sense of proving herself by her own effort. **Family considerations** also weigh in.

These societal factors might not be the most romantic reasons, but they are openly discussed as practical motivations to endure the考公 grind.

- **Societal Pressure and Stereotypes:** On the forums, there’s nuanced discussion about societal attitudes. On one hand, civil servants are seen as having *“铁饭碗”* (iron rice bowl) jobs – secure and respected. There’s a bit of prestige especially if one lands a central or provincial post. Parents often brag about kids who *“端上公务员这碗饭”* (hold the public servant rice bowl). On the other hand, candidates themselves acknowledge that the job is not glamorous or high-paying. Some even face skeptics who sneer that young people are “taking the easy way” or “just want to be officials”. A Zhihu user responded to this stereotype: *“People online reduce考公 to ‘iron rice bowl, want to be an official, no ambition,’ but that’s not the real story. We just want a fair shot to work hard and build a stable life.”* ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E5%85%AC%E8%80%83%E7%83%AD%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%AA%E6%96%B0%E8%AF%9D%E9%A2%98%EF%BC%8C%E5%8D%B4%E6%AF%8F%E5%B9%B4%E9%83%BD%E4%BC%9A%E5%BC%95%E6%9D%A5%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E8%AE%A8%E8%AE%BA%E3%80%82)) ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E9%93%81%E9%A5%AD%E7%A2%97%E2%80%9D%E3%80%81%E2%80%9C%E4%BD%93%E5%88%B6%E5%86%85%E2%80%9D%E3%80%81%E2%80%9C%E6%83%B3%E5%BD%93%E5%AE%98%E2%80%9D%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%8C%E8%88%86%E8%AE%BA%E5%AF%B9%E4%BA%8E%E5%85%AC%E8%80%83%E7%83%AD%E7%9A%84%E8%A7%A3%E8%AF%BB%E4%BC%BC%E4%B9%8E%E9%9A%BE%E9%80%83%E8%BF%99%E4%BA%9B%E5%88%BB%E6%9D%BF%E5%8D%B0%E8%B1%A1%E3%80%82)). The forums tend to be positive echo chambers about考公 (since most users there are interested in it), but they do sometimes debate criticisms. For example, a trending Xiaohongshu post titled **“10 years later:考公考编 is a huge risk”** caused a stir. The author argued that spending one’s youth on repeated attempts can backfire horribly (citing cases like that 33-year-old who died). This led to discussions where some agreed – saying life is indeed unpredictable and one shouldn’t “put all eggs in one basket” – while others defended the pursuit, saying *“If you never try, you’ll never know if you could have made it. It’s only a waste if you don’t learn or grow from it.”* The community generally encourages chasing the dream *within reason*, but stories of extreme obsession serve as cautionary tales that are taken seriously.

- **Mental Health and Peer Support:** Mental well-being is a recurring concern in these personal stories. Words like **“崩溃”** (breakdown), **“焦虑”** (anxiety), **“迷茫”** (confusion) appear frequently in posts. What’s heartening is that peers often respond with support and even **practical mental health tips**. In one Baidu Tieba thread, a user asked how to adjust mindset after a terrible exam result, confessing they felt depressed. Replies ranged from classic encouragement – *“One failure isn’t forever. As long as you don’t quit, you always have a chance”* – to pragmatic advice like *“Take a short break, do something you enjoy to clear your head, then make a new study plan”*. Some recommended exercise to fight off anxiety; others shared personal anecdotes of how they coped (one said whenever he felt overwhelmed, he’d *“go out to play hard for a day – have fun and come back refreshed”*). There’s a sense of camaraderie: *only those going through it truly understand*, so they lift each other up. It’s worth noting that a few years ago, people might have been more shy to talk about depression or seeing a therapist, but now it’s more openly discussed. The tragic stories (like the girl forced by parents who developed schizophrenia ([女子考公失败被逼疯，那些35岁还没考上公务员的人，后来怎样了_手机新浪网](http://tt.sina.cn/article_2309404916626515690823.html?cre=tianyi&mod=wapwbsx&loc=4&r=25&rfunc=31&tj=cxvertical_wapwbsx&tr=0&wm=3049_0105#:~:text=%E5%9B%9B%E5%B7%9D%E5%A7%91%E5%A8%98%E5%B0%8F%E9%98%B3%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E4%BA%8E%E6%9F%90%E2%80%9C%E5%8F%8C%E9%9D%9E%E2%80%9D%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E6%B3%95%E5%BE%8B%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E5%90%8E%E4%B8%80%E7%9B%B4%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E6%89%BE%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%8C%E8%A2%AB%E7%88%B6%E6%AF%8D%E9%80%BC%E7%9D%80%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%82))) also raised awareness that **mental health can’t be ignored** in this grind. Some community posts explicitly say: *“If preparing for this exam is destroying your mental health, *please* pause and seek help. A job is not worth your life.”* The tone around mental wellness is increasingly supportive, which is a positive trend.

- **Community Slang and Culture:** The考公 community has developed its own lingo and cultural references. We’ve mentioned *“上岸”* (to come ashore) and *“下海”* (to go out to sea, i.e. leave the public sector) ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E8%81%8C%E4%B8%9A%E6%8A%89%E6%8B%A9%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%AC%E8%80%83%E5%8F%AA%E6%98%AF%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%80)). You will also see people refer to themselves as **“公考人”** (civil exam people), almost an identity on its own. Those who decide to quit might dramatically announce *“脱坑”* (jumping out of the pit). There are references to **“公考路”** (the road of civil exam) as if it’s a pilgrimage. Success is sometimes called **“上岸成公”** (ashore and become a civil servant) ([渴望“上岸成公” 年轻人为何去考公务员？ - 新闻频道](https://news.cctv.com/2019/10/25/ARTImZq7tabQzM0LgVBGj6RV191025.shtml#:~:text=%E6%B8%B4%E6%9C%9B%E2%80%9C%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E6%88%90%E5%85%AC%E2%80%9D%20%E5%B9%B4%E8%BD%BB%E4%BA%BA%E4%B8%BA%E4%BD%95%E5%8E%BB%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%EF%BC%9F%20,%E2%80%9C%E5%9C%A8%E4%BC%97%E5%A4%9A%E5%B0%B1%E4%B8%9A%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E4%B8%AD%EF%BC%8C%E5%BE%88%E5%A4%9A%E4%BA%BA%E8%BF%98%E6%98%AF%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E8%81%8C%E4%B8%9A%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%95%E7%AB%9F)), playing on the word 公 (public). People who succeed easily are termed **“大神”** (great gods) – like *“we have a 神 in our midst who passed in one go!”*. And those who struggle long are sometimes humorously called **“毅丝”** (a pun combining “毅力” perseverance and “fans” – meaning they are die-hard long-term fighters). Sharing of **鸡汤** (lit. chicken soup, meaning motivational content) is part of the culture, but so is **吐槽** (吐槽 – good-natured complaining, to vent). Memes and jokes lighten the mood, such as *“考公人四大皆空：朋友不回，爱情没有，头发掉光，存款归零”* – *“The four emptiness of a civil exam taker: no replies from friends, no love life, hair all fallen out, bank balance back to zero.”* This self-deprecating humor helps people cope. The community feel is that *we’re all in this together, let’s keep our sense of humor while we fight*.

- **Advice Culture – Passing It On:** A strong theme is **experienced candidates advising newcomers**. Those who have been through multiple exam cycles often write long guides or answer questions to help others avoid mistakes. It’s quite collaborative. For instance, someone who finally passed after years might post “我的公考上岸经验” detailing everything from which prep books to use, how to schedule your day, down to what to wear on interview day. There’s an altruistic angle – a sense of *“I went through hell, if my experience can save you one wrong step, I’m happy.”* One shared story opened with: *“To help more fellow aspirants persevere and avoid detours, I decided to invite successful peers to share their stories.”* This led to a series of posts where each person who “上岸” wrote about their journey and study tips. It’s almost like an **oral history project** for exam candidates. The tone of advice is usually humble, acknowledging luck and personal differences. For example, *“I believe it takes both luck and strength…don’t assume studying the longest means the highest score. Be efficient and stay calm.”*. As a result, new examinees often express gratitude that these communities exist, saying they’ve learned more from peers than from any official guidebook.

In conclusion, today’s考公 online communities are a rich tapestry of personal stories that collectively narrate the hopes and struggles of a generation. From **uplifting successes** to **agonizing defeats**, from **monastic study routines** to **soul-searching life changes**, the experiences shared are diverse but interconnected by a common quest. They highlight a societal trend where increasing numbers of young people chase the promise of stability in uncertain times, even as they wrestle with the personal costs of that chase. The forums on Tieba, Xiaohongshu, Zhihu, and others serve as both **campfire and compass** – a place to find camaraderie in the grind, and guidance for the journey ahead. As one user put it: *“公考路上，有人哭，有人笑，有人疯狂，有人释然。但不管怎样，我们都在书写自己的故事。”* – *“On the road of the civil service exam, some cry, some laugh, some go crazy, some find peace. But no matter what, we are each writing our own story.”* 

And in these forums, those stories live on – instructive, relatable, and often truly inspiring – for the next wave of考公 dreamers.
