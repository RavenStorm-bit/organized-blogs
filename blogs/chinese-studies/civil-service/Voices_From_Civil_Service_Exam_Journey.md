Thanks! I’ll collect and analyze personal stories from Baidu Tieba, Xiaohongshu, and other accessible Chinese platforms (excluding Zhihu) about the civil service exam (考公). I’ll focus on posts from the past year that reflect:

- Success and failure experiences
- Personal opinions about taking the exam
- Emotional and psychological impacts

I’ll provide a report in English summarizing the key themes, quotes, and trends. I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready.

# Voices from the “考公” Journey: Personal Reflections on China’s Civil Service Exam

## Introduction  
The Chinese civil service examination (俗称“考公”) has become a near-ubiquitous pursuit among young Chinese in recent years. With over **3 million applicants vying for ~40,000 government posts in the 2024 national exam** (an average **77:1** chance) ([2024国考报名人数首破300万 笔试结束后还需注意这些！_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)](https://news.cctv.com/2023/11/26/ARTIDTO25S1DfQ8LwahjX92U231126.shtml#:~:text=%E6%8D%AE%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E5%B1%80%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%AC%E6%AC%A1%E5%9B%BD%E8%80%83%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92%E6%8B%9B%E5%BD%95%E8%A7%84%E6%A8%A1%E8%BE%BE3)), competition is fierce. This “考公热” (“civil service fever”) is fueled by a tough job market and the allure of a stable “iron rice bowl” career. To understand the human side of this phenomenon, we surveyed personal stories on Chinese social platforms (Baidu Tieba, Xiaohongshu, etc.) from the past year. These firsthand accounts – ranging from fresh graduates and big-city tech workers to rural candidates and weary repeat takers – reveal **why people choose to take (or not take) the exam, the struggles they face, and the emotional highs and lows of the journey**. Below, we summarize major themes with representative quotes (translated to English) to capture the authenticity of these voices.

## Why Take the Exam: Stability, Pressure, and Personal Choice  
**Stable Jobs and Benefits:** The dominant reason to “考公” is the promise of a secure job with good benefits. Many see government jobs as a refuge from the instability of the private sector. *“Becoming a teacher within the system looks like my only option,”* admitted one young woman, who found that contract jobs didn’t deliver promised benefits ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E7%BC%96%E5%88%B6%E5%86%85%E7%9A%84%E6%95%99%E5%B8%88%EF%BC%8C%E7%9C%8B%E8%B5%B7%E6%9D%A5%E6%98%AF%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%94%AF%E4%B8%80%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D%E8%AE%B8%E5%A4%9A%E5%B7%A1%E8%80%83%E4%BA%BA%E6%8A%8A%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A%E6%80%A7%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%EF%BC%8C%E7%99%BD%E5%8F%B6%E4%B9%9F%E6%98%AF%E5%A6%82%E6%AD%A4%E3%80%82)). A former tech employee echoed this sentiment after trading a **¥30k/month** internet job for a **¥4k/month** civil service post: *“From a 30k salary down to 4k, and it’s still worth it – at least there’s no risk of being laid off”* ([大厂5年 考公三年，终于上岸_职场_艾奇在线](https://www.27sem.com/article/8148#:~:text=%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%AD%98%E9%92%B1%EF%BC%8C%E7%84%B6%E5%90%8E%E8%B5%B6%E5%88%B035%E5%B2%81%E4%B9%8B%E5%89%8D%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E3%80%82%E8%BF%99%E5%BA%94%E8%AF%A5%E6%98%AF%E5%BE%88%E5%A4%9A%E5%9C%A8%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%91%98%E5%B7%A5%E7%9A%84%E6%A2%A6%E6%83%B3%EF%BC%8C%E9%92%B1%E8%B5%9A%E5%88%B0%E4%BA%86%EF%BC%8C%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A%E4%B9%9F%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82%E5%85%85%E5%88%86%E8%AF%A0%E9%87%8A%E4%BA%86%E6%97%A2%E8%A6%81%E3%80%81%E5%8F%88%E8%A6%81%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E6%80%9D%E6%83%B3%E3%80%82)). Stories like these show that **many are willing to sacrifice pay for the **“铁饭碗”** (iron rice bowl) of security and social insurance**. As one person noted, private companies often skimp on housing fund and social insurance, whereas *“in the public sector, five insurances and one housing fund are guaranteed by law”* ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=2021%E5%B9%B46%E6%9C%88%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E4%BB%8E%E6%B9%96%E5%8D%97%E6%9F%90%E9%AB%98%E6%A0%A1%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%A6%E5%89%8D%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%9B%E5%85%A5%E9%95%BF%E6%B2%99%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E5%AE%B6%E5%85%AC%E7%AB%8B%E5%B9%BC%E5%84%BF%E5%9B%AD%E5%81%9A%E5%90%88%E5%90%8C%E5%B7%A5%EF%BC%8C%E2%80%9C%E5%BD%93%E6%97%B6%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%E6%97%B6%EF%BC%8C%E6%8B%9B%E8%81%98%E5%B9%BF%E5%91%8A%E4%B8%8A%E7%A7%B0%E8%83%BD%E5%A4%9F%E7%BC%B4%E7%BA%B3%E4%BA%94%E9%99%A9%EF%BC%88%E5%85%BB%E8%80%81%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%A9%E3%80%81%E5%8C%BB%E7%96%97%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%A9%E3%80%81%E5%A4%B1%E4%B8%9A%20%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%A9%E3%80%81%E5%B7%A5%E4%BC%A4%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%A9%E5%92%8C%E7%94%9F%E8%82%B2%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%A9%EF%BC%89%E3%80%81%E5%8C%85%E9%A3%9F%E5%AE%BF%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%89%E5%B9%B4%E4%BB%A5%E5%90%8E%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E4%B8%80%E9%87%91%EF%BC%88%E4%BD%8F%E6%88%BF%E5%85%AC%E7%A7%AF%E9%87%91%EF%BC%89%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)).

**Social and Family Pressure:** For some, the push comes from parents or peers. A top-university graduate observed that in his master’s class of 40, *“maybe 4 went for PhDs, 5–6 into companies, and the rest – over 70% – are all taking civil service or teaching exams”* ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E7%8F%AD40%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E6%9C%894%E4%B8%AA%E8%AF%BB%E5%8D%9A%E7%9A%84%EF%BC%8C%E4%BA%94%E5%85%AD%E4%B8%AA%E5%8E%BB%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E7%9A%84%EF%BC%8C%E5%89%A9%E4%B8%8B%E5%85%A8%E6%98%AF%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E7%9A%84%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D%E5%9C%A8%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E6%9F%90%E2%80%9C985%E2%80%9D%E9%AB%98%E6%A0%A1%E8%AF%BB%E7%A0%94%E4%BA%8C%E7%9A%84%E9%98%BF%E5%B7%8D%EF%BC%8C%E7%B2%97%E7%95%A5%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E5%8F%91%E7%8E%B0%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%96%E4%BB%AC%E7%8F%AD%E6%9C%89%E8%B6%85%E8%BF%877%E6%88%90%E4%BA%BA%E6%AD%A3%E5%9C%A8%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%81%E8%80%83%E7%BC%96%20%E3%80%82)). With so many classmates studying for “考公,” it *“seems like the only thing to do.”* Families often encourage (or insist on) this path. One woman from Harbin recounted that her parents urged her to stay in her home city and attempt the provincial civil service exam ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=%E6%BB%95%E9%9B%AA%E6%98%AF%E6%88%91%E5%B8%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E6%97%A9%E4%B8%80%E6%89%B9%E5%AD%A6%E5%91%98%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%8E%E6%9D%A5%E8%BF%98%E5%92%8C%E6%88%91%E5%81%9A%E8%BF%87%E4%B8%80%E6%AE%B5%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E5%90%8C%E4%BA%8B%E3%80%82)). In extreme cases, parental pressure backfires: **a 5-year “考公” ordeal in Chengdu ended with a daughter suffering a mental breakdown**, *“answering questions incoherently and claiming she was already a bureau chief,”* according to her distraught mother ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E4%B9%9F%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%BA%E5%9B%A0%E4%B8%80%E5%91%B3%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%81%E8%80%83%E7%BC%96%E8%80%8C%E8%B5%B0%E5%90%91%E6%9E%81%E7%AB%AF%E3%80%82%E6%8D%AE%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E6%8A%A5%E9%81%93%EF%BC%8C%E5%9B%9B%E5%B7%9D%E6%88%90%E9%83%BD%E4%B8%80%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E5%90%8E%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E6%89%BE%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%8C%E8%A2%AB%E7%88%B6%E6%AF%8D%E5%BC%BA%E5%88%B6%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC5%E5%B9%B4%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E7%A1%AE%E8%AF%8A%E4%B8%BA%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E%E5%88%86%E8%A3%82%E7%97%87%E3%80%82%E6%AF%8D%E4%BA%B2%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%8C%E2%80%9C%E5%A5%B3%E5%84%BF%E4%BB%8E%E5%8E%BB%E5%B9%B4%20%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E5%B0%B1%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%E5%BC%82%E5%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%BA%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E8%BF%91%E5%92%8C%E5%AE%B6%E4%BA%BA%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E4%B9%9F%E7%BB%8F%E5%B8%B8%E7%AD%94%E9%9D%9E%E6%89%80%E9%97%AE%EF%BC%8C%E6%89%AC%E8%A8%80%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E6%98%AF%E5%B1%80%E9%95%BF%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)). Such cases are rare but highlight the heavy expectations some families place on “上岸” (landing a civil service job).

**Personal Calling vs. Opting Out:** Not everyone is swept up in the craze. A few voices reflect carefully on **whether the civil service is right for them**. *“For a specialized major like mine, taking the exam isn’t the best choice,”* said one science graduate who chose to pursue a research career instead ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E7%94%9F%E5%8C%96%E7%8E%AF%E6%9D%90%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E5%85%B7%E6%9C%89%E8%BE%83%E5%BC%BA%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E6%80%A7%EF%BC%8C%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%E5%9F%B9%E5%85%BB%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%E9%9D%A2%E5%90%91%E6%9C%AA%E6%9D%A5%E7%9A%84%E7%A7%91%E7%A0%94%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%8D%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E5%AF%B9%E6%88%91%E6%9D%A5%E8%AF%B4%E5%B9%B6%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E6%9C%80%E5%90%88%E9%80%82%E7%9A%84%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D%E5%A6%82%E4%BB%8A%EF%BC%8C%E7%8E%8B%E6%96%B0%E6%83%B3%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E6%94%BB%E8%AF%BB%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E9%A2%86%E5%9F%9F%E7%9A%84%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%94%9F%E3%80%82)). Another poster (“Phoebe”) treated the **civil service as just one option among many**. After internships and job offers in the tech industry, she still tried the exam but kept an open mind: *“So-called ‘iron rice bowl’ is just one choice. If I don’t get in, I’ll happily go work in tech – a technical role can be great too”* ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E8%99%91%E2%80%9D%E3%80%82%E5%9C%A8%E4%BB%96%E7%9C%8B%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%AA%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%BA%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E8%80%8C%E5%B7%A1%E8%80%83%EF%BC%8C%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E7%BB%BC%E5%90%88%E8%80%83%E9%87%8F%E8%87%AA%E8%BA%AB%E9%9C%80%E8%A6%81%E5%92%8C%E5%B2%97%E4%BD%8D%E5%8C%B9%E9%85%8D%E5%BA%A6%EF%BC%8C%E5%8D%B3%E4%BE%BF%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E4%B9%9F%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E9%9A%BE%E4%BB%A5%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%97%EF%BC%8C%E7%94%9A%E8%87%B3%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E8%9E%8D%E5%85%A5%E5%BD%93%E5%9C%B0%EF%BC%8C%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8D%E4%BA%86%E8%87%AA%E8%BA%AB%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%99%E9%83%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%9C%A8%E7%9B%B2%E7%9B%AE%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%82)). Similarly, some advise against **“taking the exam just for the sake of getting in”** without considering personal fit: *“If you land a post you don’t actually want or can’t adapt to the city, it won’t be satisfying – that’s blind ‘考公’”* warns one graduate who prioritized career growth and location over simply any government job ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AE%B6%E9%83%BD%E6%83%B3%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%EF%BC%8C%E6%89%80%E4%BB%A5%E6%89%8D%E5%87%BA%E7%8E%B0%E4%BA%86%E5%B7%A1%E8%80%83%E7%8E%B0%E8%B1%A1%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D%E9%98%BF%E5%B7%8D%E8%A7%89%E5%BE%97%EF%BC%8C%E6%B2%A1%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81%E8%BF%87%E5%88%86%E8%8B%9B%E8%B4%A3%E5%B7%A1%E8%80%83%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E4%BA%BA%E4%BB%AC%E9%9D%A2%E4%B8%B4%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%BA%E4%BC%9A%E9%83%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%85%AC%E5%B9%B3%E7%9A%84%EF%BC%8C%E2%80%9C%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%BA%E5%90%8C%E6%97%B6%E8%80%83%E4%B8%8A%E4%BA%86%E5%87%A0%E4%B8%AA%E5%B2%97%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AA%E8%83%BD%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E5%B2%97%E4%BD%8D%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%8E%E9%9D%A2%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%BA%E4%BC%9A%E4%B9%9F%20%E6%98%AF%E7%95%99%E7%BB%99%E6%9C%89%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)).

While perseverance is celebrated, the **emotional toll** of “考公” is a recurring theme. **Stress, anxiety, and self-doubt** permeate many personal accounts, even if not everyone admits it openly. *“Of course, besides hard work, there’s a luck factor,”* one persistent exam-taker sighed, noting how she had *“missed the cutoff by 0.1 or 0.2 points”* multiple times ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E6%9C%80%E5%88%9D%EF%BC%8C%E5%B0%8F%E6%98%A5%E6%84%9F%E8%A7%89%E5%A4%87%E8%80%83%E2%80%9C%E6%9C%89%E7%82%B9%E9%9A%BE%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E5%A5%B9%E5%AD%A6%E8%BF%9B%E5%8E%BB%E5%90%8E%E5%8F%91%E7%8E%B0%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%A4%E9%97%A8%E7%A7%91%E7%9B%AE%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E8%81%8C%E4%B8%9A%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E6%B5%8B%E9%AA%8C%EF%BC%88%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%EF%BC%89%E5%92%8C%E7%94%B3%E8%AE%BA%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E7%A7%AF%E7%B4%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%96%E5%A4%9A%E6%88%96%E5%B0%91%E6%9C%89%E6%89%80%E5%82%A8%E5%A4%87%EF%BC%8C%E2%80%9C%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E6%B2%A1%20%E6%9C%89%E6%89%80%E8%B0%93%E7%9A%84%E2%80%98%E9%9B%B6%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E2%80%99%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)). Near-misses like these can be crushing. Some describe the civil service prep as an emotional rollercoaster of hope and disappointment that can **strain mental health** and relationships.

**Anxiety and Burnout:** High stakes and repetitive failure can lead to severe anxiety. One poster confessed that after months of futile studying, *“she started becoming extremely anxious. Living under the same roof with her parents didn’t help – the pressure made her so sensitive that even a small disagreement would erupt into a huge fight.”* ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=%E5%86%8D%E5%90%8E%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E7%90%86%E8%A7%A3%E4%BA%86%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%E5%8F%88%E4%B8%8D%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E8%AF%A5%E6%80%8E%E4%B9%88%E6%8A%8A%E8%AF%8D%E8%AF%AD%E8%83%8C%E4%B8%8B%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%B0%B1%E5%9C%A8%E7%BD%91%E4%B8%8A%E4%B9%B0%E4%BA%86%E8%AE%B0%E5%BF%86%E5%A4%A7%E5%B8%88%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%BE%E7%A8%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%83%B3%E8%A6%81%E6%8F%90%E9%AB%98%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%9A%84%E8%AE%B0%E5%BF%86%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%82)) In her case, the stress was **eroding family relationships**. Another user, preparing full-time at home, shared that she felt *“if I don’t pass this year, I’m done for”* – a sense of doom that hung over her ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E5%8E%86%E7%BB%8F%E5%B7%A1%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84%E5%B0%8F%E6%98%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%88%87%E8%BA%AB%E4%BD%93%E4%BC%9A%E5%88%B0%E2%80%9C%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E2%80%9D%E7%9A%84%E6%84%9F%E5%8F%97%E3%80%82%E5%A6%82%E4%BB%8A%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E8%BF%9B%E5%85%A5%E5%B9%BF%E4%B8%9C%E6%9F%90%E5%B8%82%E8%87%AA%E7%84%B6%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%E5%B1%80%E7%9A%84%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%EF%BC%8C%E2%80%9C%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E5%87%A0%E7%8E%87%E5%BE%88%E5%A4%A7%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E6%9B%BE%E7%BB%8F%E7%9A%84%E7%84%A6%E8%99%91%E8%BF%B7%E8%8C%AB%E4%BB%8D%E4%BB%A4%E5%A5%B9%E9%9A%BE%E4%BB%A5%E5%BF%98%E6%80%80%E3%80%82)). **Burnout** is frequently mentioned. The combination of long study hours, financial strain, and social isolation leads some to physical and mental exhaustion. A few admit they lost weight or developed insomnia while preparing. In the worst scenario mentioned (the Chengdu case), relentless exam pressure without success led to a **mental health crisis**: the candidate literally lost touch with reality ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E4%B9%9F%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%BA%E5%9B%A0%E4%B8%80%E5%91%B3%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%81%E8%80%83%E7%BC%96%E8%80%8C%E8%B5%B0%E5%90%91%E6%9E%81%E7%AB%AF%E3%80%82%E6%8D%AE%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E6%8A%A5%E9%81%93%EF%BC%8C%E5%9B%9B%E5%B7%9D%E6%88%90%E9%83%BD%E4%B8%80%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E5%90%8E%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E6%89%BE%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%8C%E8%A2%AB%E7%88%B6%E6%AF%8D%E5%BC%BA%E5%88%B6%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC5%E5%B9%B4%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E7%A1%AE%E8%AF%8A%E4%B8%BA%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E%E5%88%86%E8%A3%82%E7%97%87%E3%80%82%E6%AF%8D%E4%BA%B2%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%8C%E2%80%9C%E5%A5%B3%E5%84%BF%E4%BB%8E%E5%8E%BB%E5%B9%B4%20%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E5%B0%B1%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%E5%BC%82%E5%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%BA%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E8%BF%91%E5%92%8C%E5%AE%B6%E4%BA%BA%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E4%B9%9F%E7%BB%8F%E5%B8%B8%E7%AD%94%E9%9D%9E%E6%89%80%E9%97%AE%EF%BC%8C%E6%89%AC%E8%A8%80%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E6%98%AF%E5%B1%80%E9%95%BF%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)). *“Not everyone handles this kind of stress well,”* one commenter warned, citing that case as a cautionary tale of pushing too far.

**Feelings of Envy and Uncertainty:** Those still struggling often write about the emotional impact of seeing others succeed. *“I know this path is hard,”* said one persistent woman, *“but when I see others pass, I’m **so jealous** – I want that life so badly.”* ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=%E6%88%91%E5%AF%B9%E5%A5%B9%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%9A%E2%80%9C%E8%99%BD%E7%84%B6%E6%88%91%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E8%80%81%E5%B8%88%E4%B8%8D%E5%BA%94%E8%AF%A5%E8%AF%B4%E8%BF%99%E6%A0%B7%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%9D%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E7%9C%9F%E5%BF%83%E5%8A%9D%E4%BD%A0%E6%85%8E%E9%87%8D%E8%80%83%E8%99%91%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%8B%EF%BC%8C%E8%A6%81%E4%B8%8D%E8%A6%81%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)) This mix of envy and longing can either motivate or demoralize. **Uncertainty about the future** is another burden – some worry they are “wasting” years of their youth if they never succeed. One person’s mentor even stepped in and advised her to reconsider: *“As a friend, I sincerely urge you to think carefully – do you really want to keep doing this?”* ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=match%20at%20L274%20%E6%88%91%E5%AF%B9%E5%A5%B9%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%9A%E2%80%9C%E8%99%BD%E7%84%B6%E6%88%91%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E8%80%81%E5%B8%88%E4%B8%8D%E5%BA%94%E8%AF%A5%E8%AF%B4%E8%BF%99%E6%A0%B7%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%9D%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E7%9C%9F%E5%BF%83%E5%8A%9D%E4%BD%A0%E6%85%8E%E9%87%8D%E8%80%83%E8%99%91%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%8B%EF%BC%8C%E8%A6%81%E4%B8%8D%E8%A6%81%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)). He feared she was putting her life on hold indefinitely. Posts like these reveal the **intense internal conflicts** many face: the desire to keep trying versus the fear of failing endlessly.

**Family Dynamics:** Family can be a double-edged sword. Some families are supportive (providing housing and moral support while the child studies), but others add pressure, whether intentional or not. We saw examples of both gentle concern and harsh ultimatums. *“I really don’t want to fight with my parents, but…,”* one user wrote, describing how tensions flared at home due to her prolonged joblessness and exam focus ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=%E5%86%8D%E5%90%8E%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E7%90%86%E8%A7%A3%E4%BA%86%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%E5%8F%88%E4%B8%8D%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E8%AF%A5%E6%80%8E%E4%B9%88%E6%8A%8A%E8%AF%8D%E8%AF%AD%E8%83%8C%E4%B8%8B%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%B0%B1%E5%9C%A8%E7%BD%91%E4%B8%8A%E4%B9%B0%E4%BA%86%E8%AE%B0%E5%BF%86%E5%A4%A7%E5%B8%88%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%BE%E7%A8%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%83%B3%E8%A6%81%E6%8F%90%E9%AB%98%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%9A%84%E8%AE%B0%E5%BF%86%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%82)). In contrast, another account mentioned parents who eventually accepted their child’s decision to stop and pursue another career, prioritizing her well-being. **Marital and relationship considerations** also appear: a few older posters mentioned feeling the pressure of age not just for the exam cutoff but for starting a family. One woman in her early 30s, after repeated exam tries, decided to focus on her personal life. She got engaged and joked, *“Haha, given my situation, this is the best match I could hope for.”* ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=%E5%A5%B9%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%9A%E2%80%9C%E5%93%88%E5%93%88%E5%93%88%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%A5%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E6%9D%A1%E4%BB%B6%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%99%E6%98%AF%E6%88%91%E8%83%BD%E5%8C%B9%E9%85%8D%E5%88%B0%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E5%A5%BD%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)) It was a bittersweet recognition that she was stepping away from the exam grind and choosing an alternative path.

Overall, these candid stories lay bare the **psychological costs** of the civil service quest: the tunnel vision of chasing a goal, the loneliness and frustration when it’s out of reach, and the resilience (or in some cases breakdowns) that result. As one article summarized, *“whether or not you land the job, you have to keep walking your own path to find your answer for the future”* ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E7%94%9F%E5%8C%96%E7%8E%AF%E6%9D%90%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E5%85%B7%E6%9C%89%E8%BE%83%E5%BC%BA%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E6%80%A7%EF%BC%8C%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%E5%9F%B9%E5%85%BB%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%E9%9D%A2%E5%90%91%E6%9C%AA%E6%9D%A5%E7%9A%84%E7%A7%91%E7%A0%94%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%8D%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E5%AF%B9%E6%88%91%E6%9D%A5%E8%AF%B4%E5%B9%B6%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E6%9C%80%E5%90%88%E9%80%82%E7%9A%84%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D%E5%A6%82%E4%BB%8A%EF%BC%8C%E7%8E%8B%E6%96%B0%E6%83%B3%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E6%94%BB%E8%AF%BB%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E9%A2%86%E5%9F%9F%E7%9A%84%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%94%9F%E3%80%82)) – a reminder that life goes on beyond the exam, however all-consuming it feels in the moment.

## Success and Relief: “Finally Made It!”  
Amid the struggles, the **euphoria of success** shines through in many posts from those who finally “上岸”. Passing the exam (often after multiple attempts) is described as an almost life-altering victory bringing intense relief, joy, and validation. **“终于上岸了!” (“I’ve finally landed!”)** wrote one user, Wu Jiang, when he saw his name on a government hiring list ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E8%8F%B2%E6%AF%94%E5%8F%82%E5%8A%A0%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E7%9A%84%E5%87%86%E8%80%83%E8%AF%81%E3%80%82%E5%8F%97%E8%AE%BF%E8%80%85%E4%BE%9B%E5%9B%BE)). This simple exclamation captures the *huge weight off one’s shoulders* that many describe.

Successful candidates often share a sense of *exhaustion melting into exhilaration*. One netizen vividly recounted the moments after her final interview: *“Knowing I’d passed, I joked and laughed in the taxi all the way home. Then I played the climax of **‘Chasing Dreams’** and just broke down crying – tears of joy! All the grievances and effort… none of it was wasted. Heaven really doesn’t let down a person who keeps trying!”* ([公务员考试成功上岸的体验，到底有多爽？_网友](https://www.sohu.com/a/404711872_100080725#:~:text=Image)). Another compared the feeling to *“crawling out of an abyss and finally able to breathe, like climbing a high mountain and seeing a beautiful future”* ([公务员考试成功上岸的体验，到底有多爽？_网友](https://www.sohu.com/a/404711872_100080725#:~:text=%E4%BD%93%E9%AA%8C%E5%B0%B1%E6%98%AF%EF%BC%8C%E7%BB%83%E5%A5%BD%E8%A1%8C%E6%B5%8B%E9%9D%9E%E5%B8%B8%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%EF%BC%8C%E5%A4%A7%E6%A6%82%E5%88%B7%E4%BA%863000%E5%A4%9A%E9%81%93%E9%A2%98%E3%80%82%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%E5%81%9A%E9%A2%98%E9%A1%BA%E5%BA%8F%E9%9D%9E%E5%B8%B8%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%EF%BC%8C%E5%9B%BD%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%E5%9C%A8%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E15%E5%88%86%E9%92%9F%E5%81%9A%E5%AE%8C40%E9%81%93%E8%AF%AD%E6%96%87%E9%A2%98%E4%BB%A5%E5%8F%8A%E6%B6%82%E5%8D%A1%E3%80%82)). These emotional testimonies show how **years of effort and pressure release in an outpouring of relief** once the goal is achieved. *“All the effort was worth it,”* is a common refrain.

For those who switched from other careers, success brings confirmation that they made the right choice. *“I have no regrets leaving my old job for this,”* said the former ByteDance engineer, who now enjoys peace of mind despite a lower salary ([大厂5年 考公三年，终于上岸_职场_艾奇在线](https://www.27sem.com/article/8148#:~:text=%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%AD%98%E9%92%B1%EF%BC%8C%E7%84%B6%E5%90%8E%E8%B5%B6%E5%88%B035%E5%B2%81%E4%B9%8B%E5%89%8D%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E3%80%82%E8%BF%99%E5%BA%94%E8%AF%A5%E6%98%AF%E5%BE%88%E5%A4%9A%E5%9C%A8%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%91%98%E5%B7%A5%E7%9A%84%E6%A2%A6%E6%83%B3%EF%BC%8C%E9%92%B1%E8%B5%9A%E5%88%B0%E4%BA%86%EF%BC%8C%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A%E4%B9%9F%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82%E5%85%85%E5%88%86%E8%AF%A0%E9%87%8A%E4%BA%86%E6%97%A2%E8%A6%81%E3%80%81%E5%8F%88%E8%A6%81%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E6%80%9D%E6%83%B3%E3%80%82)). Others talk about the reactions of proud parents, the *“finally can make them proud (or stop their worries)”* sentiment that comes with securing a respected government position. There is also a theme of *“new beginnings.”* A young man nicknamed A-Wei, who succeeded after applying to seven different posts, ended up in his ideal agency. He wrote that he can *“finally put my degree in diplomacy to use serving the public, which gives me a real sense of accomplishment and value”* ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E7%94%9F%E5%8C%96%E7%8E%AF%E6%9D%90%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E5%85%B7%E6%9C%89%E8%BE%83%E5%BC%BA%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%93%E4%B8%9A%E6%80%A7%EF%BC%8C%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%E5%9F%B9%E5%85%BB%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%E9%9D%A2%E5%90%91%E6%9C%AA%E6%9D%A5%E7%9A%84%E7%A7%91%E7%A0%94%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%8D%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%E5%AF%B9%E6%88%91%E6%9D%A5%E8%AF%B4%E5%B9%B6%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E6%9C%80%E5%90%88%E9%80%82%E7%9A%84%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D%E5%A6%82%E4%BB%8A%EF%BC%8C%E7%8E%8B%E6%96%B0%E6%83%B3%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E6%94%BB%E8%AF%BB%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E9%A2%86%E5%9F%9F%E7%9A%84%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%94%9F%E3%80%82)). For him and many others, **landing the job is not just an end but the start of a hopeful new chapter**.

At the same time, a few tempered voices remind peers that *“上岸 isn’t the finish line of your struggles”*. In other words, life (and one’s career growth) continues after getting the job. *“Don’t become complacent; getting in doesn’t mean you can slack off,”* one successful candidate advised newbies, noting that some new civil servants faced challenges on the job despite thinking they were “set for life” ([@新公务员摆正“姿态”才能稳步“向前”_先锋文汇_共产党员网](https://tougao.12371.cn/gaojian.php?tid=3705746#:~:text=%40%E6%96%B0%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E6%91%86%E6%AD%A3%E2%80%9C%E5%A7%BF%E6%80%81%E2%80%9D%E6%89%8D%E8%83%BD%E7%A8%B3%E6%AD%A5%E2%80%9C%E5%90%91%E5%89%8D%E2%80%9D_%E5%85%88%E9%94%8B%E6%96%87%E6%B1%87_%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%A7%E5%85%9A%E5%91%98%E7%BD%91%20%E8%BF%85%E9%80%9F%E8%B0%83%E6%95%B4%E5%BF%83%E6%80%81%EF%BC%8C%E6%91%92%E5%BC%83%E2%80%9C%E5%BF%97%E5%BE%97%E6%84%8F%E6%BB%A1%E3%80%81%E6%97%A0%E6%AC%B2%E6%97%A0%E6%B1%82%E2%80%9D%E7%9A%84%E8%88%92%E9%80%82%E6%84%9F%E3%80%82%E8%BF%9B%E5%85%A5%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E9%98%9F%E4%BC%8D%E7%9A%84%E7%A1%AE%E5%80%BC%E5%BE%97%E5%BA%86%E7%A5%9D%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E5%B0%91%E6%95%B0%E6%96%B0%E5%BD%95%E7%94%A8%E5%85%AC%E5%8A%A1%E5%91%98%E8%A7%89%E5%BE%97%E6%88%90%E2%80%9C%E5%85%AC%E2%80%9D%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%E5%B0%B1%E2%80%9C%E7%A8%B3%E2%80%9D%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82%E6%9C%89%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%8F%E5%B8%B8%E7%94%A8%E2%80%9C%E6%88%91%E4%B8%8D%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9C%E6%88%91%E4%B8%8D%E4%BC%9A%E2%80%9D%E7%AD%89%E8%8D%92%20%E8%B0%AC%E5%8F%AF%E7%AC%91%20)). But such cautionary advice is rare in personal posts compared to the overwhelming relief and happiness. In the stories we gathered, **the moment of success is often portrayed as one of the happiest and most triumphant in life**, often celebrated with tears, grateful messages, and even the literal *singing of victory songs*. It’s a hard-won dream come true.

## Different Perspectives by Demographic  
Individuals’ experiences and attitudes toward the “考公” process can vary by their background and demographics. Here we highlight a few distinct perspectives:

- **College Students & New Graduates:**  For many graduating students, civil service exams are almost a default path in an uncertain job market. Seeing most of their peers preparing fosters a *“herd mentality”*. They often devote themselves full-time to studying after college. The upside is they are young and can afford a few gap years; the downside is high anxiety due to lack of income and fear of falling behind. *“I felt if I didn’t get in, my life was ruined,”* said one recent grad, who later realized this wasn’t true ([巡考大军：为“上岸”放手一搏是否值得](http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2023-04/11/nw.D110000zgqnb_20230411_1-11.htm#:~:text=2021%E5%B9%B4%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%95%EF%BC%8C%E5%B0%8F%E6%98%A5%E6%AD%A3%E7%B4%A7%E5%BC%A0%E5%9C%B0%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E8%80%83%E7%A0%94%E5%88%9D%E8%AF%95%EF%BC%8C%E2%80%9C%E5%BD%93%E6%97%B6%E6%84%9F%E8%A7%89%E8%80%83%E4%B8%8D%E4%B8%8A%E7%A0%94%EF%BC%8C%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F%E5%B0%B1%E5%AE%8C%E8%9B%8B%E4%BA%86%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)). Many eventually adjust expectations or try alternate exams (like graduate school or teaching) in parallel. Support from parents is common in this group, though it can turn to pressure if years pass with no success.

- **Big City vs. Small City Candidates:** Location plays a big role in the experience. **Urban candidates** often face fiercer competition (since everyone wants postings in major cities) and may be picky about which jobs to take. For example, one woman *gave up a chance* in a smaller city after passing the written exam, because she *“always wanted to stay in Harbin”* ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=%E5%B0%B1%E5%9C%A8%E6%BB%95%E9%9B%AA%E5%87%A0%E4%B9%8E%E5%BF%AB%E5%BF%98%E4%BA%86%E8%BF%99%E6%AC%A1%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E6%8E%A5%E5%88%B0%E4%BA%86%E6%8B%9B%E8%80%83%E9%83%A8%E9%97%A8%E7%9A%84%E7%94%B5%E8%AF%9D%EF%BC%8C%E5%89%8D%E9%9D%A2%E4%B8%89%E5%90%8D%E5%90%8C%E5%AD%A6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%8E%BB%E5%8F%82%E5%8A%A0%E8%B5%84%E6%A0%BC%E5%AE%A1%E6%9F%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E7%AC%AC%E5%9B%9B%E5%90%8D%EF%BC%8C%E9%80%92%E8%A1%A5%E6%88%90%E4%BA%86%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%90%8D%EF%BC%8C%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E4%BA%BA%E5%91%98%E9%80%9A%E7%9F%A5%E5%A5%B9%E5%8E%BB%E8%B5%84%E6%A0%BC%E5%AE%A1%E6%9F%A5%E3%80%82)). She decided to try again next year rather than move to a “particularly remote place” she wasn’t ready to settle in. This gamble can prolong the journey. **Rural or small-town candidates**, or those from big cities who are open to relocating, might apply more broadly. Some big-city professionals actually *want* to go to a smaller city (often their hometown) once they have a stable civil service job. One tech worker noted many colleagues *“plan to take the money they saved in the big city and go back home”* – but only if they can secure a government job there, since *“there are few good jobs back home otherwise”* ([大厂5年 考公三年，终于上岸_职场_艾奇在线](https://www.27sem.com/article/8148#:~:text=%E8%A7%82%E8%8A%B1%EF%BC%8C%E5%9B%AB%E5%9B%B5%E5%90%9E%E6%9E%A3%E3%80%82%E5%B0%B1%E8%BF%99%E6%A0%B7%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%EF%BC%8C%E6%8E%A5%E8%BF%91%E4%BA%8E%E8%A3%B8%E8%80%83%E3%80%82%E7%84%B6%E8%80%8C%E5%87%BA%E4%B9%8E%E6%84%8F%E6%96%99%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%EF%BC%8C%E7%AC%94%E8%AF%95%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9%E5%85%AC%E5%B8%83%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%AB%9F%E7%84%B6%E4%BB%A5%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E4%B8%80%E5%90%8D%E8%BF%9B%E4%BA%86%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%EF%BC%8C%E8%99%BD%E7%84%B6%E6%9C%80%E7%BB%88%E6%B2%A1%E8%83%BD%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E8%BF%99%E6%AC%A1%E7%BB%8F%E5%8E%86%E7%BB%99%E4%BA%86%E6%88%91%E6%9E%81%E5%A4%A7%E7%9A%84%E4%BF%A1%20%E5%BF%83%E3%80%82%E5%BB%BA%E8%AE%AE35%E5%B2%81%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8B%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E5%91%98%E5%B7%A5%E9%83%BD%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E5%B0%9D%E8%AF%95%E4%B8%8B%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%EF%BC%8C%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%80%BA%E5%8A%A1%E5%8D%B1%E6%9C%BA%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%95%E8%96%AA%E8%B5%84%E6%89%93%E6%8A%98%E3%80%82%E5%AF%B9%E4%BA%8E%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E5%91%98%E5%B7%A5%E6%9D%A5%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%8C30%E5%A4%9A%E5%B2%81%E8%BF%98%E6%98%AF%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%B4%E5%85%B5%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8D%E5%9C%A8%E5%B0%91%E6%95%B0%EF%BC%8C%E8%99%BD%E7%84%B6%E5%A4%96%E8%A1%A8%E5%85%89%E9%B2%9C%E4%BA%AE%E4%B8%BD%E3%80%81%E8%96%AA%E8%B5%84%E5%BE%85%E9%81%87%E4%B8%8D%E4%BD%8E%EF%BC%8C%20%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E8%BF%91%E4%BA%9B%E5%B9%B4%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E9%99%8D%E6%9C%AC%E5%A2%9E%E6%95%88%EF%BC%88%E8%A3%81%E5%91%98%EF%BC%89%E5%A6%82%E5%90%8C%E8%BE%BE%E6%91%A9%E5%85%8B%E9%87%8C%E6%96%AF%E4%B9%8B%E5%89%91%E6%82%AC%E5%9C%A8%E6%AF%8F%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%A4%B4%E4%B8%8A%E3%80%82%E5%B0%B1%E6%8B%BF%E8%BA%AB%E8%BE%B9%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8C%E4%BA%8B%E6%9D%A5%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%8C%E5%BE%88%E5%A4%9A%E4%BA%BA%E9%83%BD%E6%9C%89%E5%9B%9E%E8%80%81%E5%AE%B6%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%E7%9A%84%E6%89%93%E7%AE%97%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%88%E4%BD%95%E8%80%81%E5%AE%B6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%90%88%E9%80%82%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%B2%97%E4%BD%8D%E3%80%82%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E8%83%BD%E8%80%83%E4%B8%8A%E5%AE%B6%E4%B9%A1%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%93%20%E5%88%B6%E5%86%85%EF%BC%8C%E6%8B%BF%E7%9D%80%E5%9C%A8%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E8%B5%9A%E5%88%B0%E7%9A%84%E9%92%B1%E5%9B%9E%E5%AE%B6%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%99%E7%BB%9D%E5%AF%B9%E6%98%AF%E7%A6%BB%E5%BC%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%EF%BC%88%E7%94%9A%E8%87%B3%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%EF%BC%89%E4%B8%8D%E9%94%99%E7%9A%84%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%80%E3%80%82%E6%8A%A5%E5%90%8D%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E6%88%90%E6%9C%AC%E5%BE%88%E4%BD%8E%EF%BC%8C%E9%9D%9E%E5%B8%B8%E9%80%82%E5%90%88%E5%9C%A8%E8%81%8C%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E3%80%82%20%E4%B8%8A%E5%9B%BE%E6%98%AF%E6%88%91%E5%8F%82%E5%8A%A02023%E5%B9%B4%E6%B5%99%E6%B1%9F%E7%9C%81%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84)). In short, those flexible on location (willing to serve in western regions, rural counties, etc.) sometimes have an easier time landing a position, while those fixated on Tier-1 cities may endure more failure but are chasing a specific lifestyle.

- **Private Sector Professionals:** Young professionals from the corporate world (especially the **“996” tech sector) are a notable subgroup joining the civil service frenzy. Burnt out by long hours or uneasy about layoffs, they view “考公” as an exit strategy. Their stories often mention **trade-offs**: high pay versus high stress. *“After a few years, so many of us tech people realize we’re still just grunts in the company,”* a 28-year-old wrote, *“Meanwhile layoffs hang over us like a sword. If I can get a stable job back home, even at half the pay, I’d take it.”* ([大厂5年 考公三年，终于上岸_职场_艾奇在线](https://www.27sem.com/article/8148#:~:text=%E8%A7%82%E8%8A%B1%EF%BC%8C%E5%9B%AB%E5%9B%B5%E5%90%9E%E6%9E%A3%E3%80%82%E5%B0%B1%E8%BF%99%E6%A0%B7%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%EF%BC%8C%E6%8E%A5%E8%BF%91%E4%BA%8E%E8%A3%B8%E8%80%83%E3%80%82%E7%84%B6%E8%80%8C%E5%87%BA%E4%B9%8E%E6%84%8F%E6%96%99%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%EF%BC%8C%E7%AC%94%E8%AF%95%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9%E5%85%AC%E5%B8%83%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%8C%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%AB%9F%E7%84%B6%E4%BB%A5%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E4%B8%80%E5%90%8D%E8%BF%9B%E4%BA%86%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%EF%BC%8C%E8%99%BD%E7%84%B6%E6%9C%80%E7%BB%88%E6%B2%A1%E8%83%BD%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E8%BF%99%E6%AC%A1%E7%BB%8F%E5%8E%86%E7%BB%99%E4%BA%86%E6%88%91%E6%9E%81%E5%A4%A7%E7%9A%84%E4%BF%A1%20%E5%BF%83%E3%80%82%E5%BB%BA%E8%AE%AE35%E5%B2%81%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8B%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E5%91%98%E5%B7%A5%E9%83%BD%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E5%B0%9D%E8%AF%95%E4%B8%8B%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%EF%BC%8C%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%80%BA%E5%8A%A1%E5%8D%B1%E6%9C%BA%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%95%E8%96%AA%E8%B5%84%E6%89%93%E6%8A%98%E3%80%82%E5%AF%B9%E4%BA%8E%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E5%91%98%E5%B7%A5%E6%9D%A5%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%8C30%E5%A4%9A%E5%B2%81%E8%BF%98%E6%98%AF%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%B4%E5%85%B5%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8D%E5%9C%A8%E5%B0%91%E6%95%B0%EF%BC%8C%E8%99%BD%E7%84%B6%E5%A4%96%E8%A1%A8%E5%85%89%E9%B2%9C%E4%BA%AE%E4%B8%BD%E3%80%81%E8%96%AA%E8%B5%84%E5%BE%85%E9%81%87%E4%B8%8D%E4%BD%8E%EF%BC%8C%20%E4%BD%86%E6%98%AF%E8%BF%91%E4%BA%9B%E5%B9%B4%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E9%99%8D%E6%9C%AC%E5%A2%9E%E6%95%88%EF%BC%88%E8%A3%81%E5%91%98%EF%BC%89%E5%A6%82%E5%90%8C%E8%BE%BE%E6%91%A9%E5%85%8B%E9%87%8C%E6%96%AF%E4%B9%8B%E5%89%91%E6%82%AC%E5%9C%A8%E6%AF%8F%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%A4%B4%E4%B8%8A%E3%80%82%E5%B0%B1%E6%8B%BF%E8%BA%AB%E8%BE%B9%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8C%E4%BA%8B%E6%9D%A5%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%8C%E5%BE%88%E5%A4%9A%E4%BA%BA%E9%83%BD%E6%9C%89%E5%9B%9E%E8%80%81%E5%AE%B6%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%E7%9A%84%E6%89%93%E7%AE%97%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%88%E4%BD%95%E8%80%81%E5%AE%B6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%90%88%E9%80%82%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%B2%97%E4%BD%8D%E3%80%82%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E8%83%BD%E8%80%83%E4%B8%8A%E5%AE%B6%E4%B9%A1%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%93%20%E5%88%B6%E5%86%85%EF%BC%8C%E6%8B%BF%E7%9D%80%E5%9C%A8%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E8%B5%9A%E5%88%B0%E7%9A%84%E9%92%B1%E5%9B%9E%E5%AE%B6%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%99%E7%BB%9D%E5%AF%B9%E6%98%AF%E7%A6%BB%E5%BC%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%EF%BC%88%E7%94%9A%E8%87%B3%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%EF%BC%89%E4%B8%8D%E9%94%99%E7%9A%84%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%80%E3%80%82%E6%8A%A5%E5%90%8D%E8%80%83%E8%AF%95%E6%88%90%E6%9C%AC%E5%BE%88%E4%BD%8E%EF%BC%8C%E9%9D%9E%E5%B8%B8%E9%80%82%E5%90%88%E5%9C%A8%E8%81%8C%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E3%80%82%20%E4%B8%8A%E5%9B%BE%E6%98%AF%E6%88%91%E5%8F%82%E5%8A%A02023%E5%B9%B4%E6%B5%99%E6%B1%9F%E7%9C%81%E8%80%83%E7%9A%84)) These individuals often prepare while working, squeezing study time around a demanding job. One woman managed to study and sit for exams even while working at a famously intense e-commerce firm (with an “11-11-6” schedule, meaning 11am–11pm, 6 days/week). It took her a couple of years, but she *“kept signing up for any suitable opening”* and eventually succeeded ([大厂5年 考公三年，终于上岸_职场_艾奇在线](https://www.27sem.com/article/8148#:~:text=%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E7%A7%AF%E7%B4%AF%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%80%E7%BB%88%E4%B9%9F%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E7%9A%84%E3%80%82%E8%BF%99%E6%A0%B7%E7%AE%97%E4%B8%8B%E6%9D%A5%E7%9A%84%E8%AF%9D%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%98%E5%87%BA%E9%87%91%E9%92%B1%E4%B8%8D%E5%A4%9A%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AA%E9%9C%80%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%9A%84%E5%8A%AA%E5%8A%9B%E6%8D%A2%E6%9D%A5%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E7%BB%88%E8%BA%AB%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%8C%E5%BE%88%E5%88%92%E7%AE%97%E7%9A%84%E3%80%82%20%E8%AF%B4%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E5%A4%A7%E5%8E%82%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8%E7%9A%84%E4%BE%8B%E5%AD%90%E3%80%8218%E5%B9%B4%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E8%BF%9B%E5%85%A5%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E6%9F%90%E5%A4%96%E8%B5%84%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%EF%BC%8C19%E5%B9%B4%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B%E5%9C%A8%E8%81%8C%E8%80%83%E5%85%AC%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%99%E6%9C%9F%E9%97%B4%E5%9C%A821%E5%B9%B4%E8%BF%98%E8%B7%B3%E6%A7%BD%E5%88%B0%E4%BA%86PDD%E3%80%82%E8%A6%81%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93PDD%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%BC%BA%E5%BA%A6%EF%BC%8C11)). For this cohort, passing the exam feels like a *liberation* from corporate life. They frequently encourage their peers to try, portraying it as “not too costly, nothing to lose.” However, if they fail, many continue their careers or try again the next year – their perspective tends to be pragmatic and resilient, using work experience as an advantage in interviews.

- **Older Aspirants (“大龄考公人”):** Those in their late 20s and 30s often write with a heightened sense of urgency. They know the **window is closing** (with age limits approaching) and many have already faced repeated failures. It’s common to see posts by 30-somethings who have taken the exam yearly since graduation. *“Six years, ten exams… I finally caught the last train!”* wrote one person in their mid-30s, referring to passing just before aging out. These older candidates tend to emphasize **determination and hope against the odds**, but also speak about exhaustion. One such poster, who had not succeeded after years, discussed how she juggled part-time work with studying and was prepared to continue until 35 ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=match%20at%20L309%20%E4%BD%86%E6%9D%8E%E8%8E%8E%E6%8B%92%E7%BB%9D%E4%BA%86%E8%80%81%E6%9D%BF%E7%9A%84%E5%A5%BD%E6%84%8F%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B9%E8%AF%B4%EF%BC%9A%E2%80%9C%E6%88%91%E6%83%B3%E4%B8%80%E8%BE%B9%E5%81%9A%E5%85%BC%E8%81%8C%E4%B8%80%E8%BE%B9%E5%A4%87%E8%80%83%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%83%E5%88%B0%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B135%E5%B2%81%EF%BC%8C%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E5%AE%9E%E5%9C%A8%E8%80%83%E4%B8%8D%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E5%86%8D%E7%95%99%E4%B8%8B%E5%81%9A%E5%85%A8%E8%81%8C%E3%80%82%E2%80%9D)). The emotional stakes are high – some mention delaying marriage or kids until they “secure” their career. We also see **some reconsideration** in this group: a few decide to pivot to other jobs or further study rather than keep trying indefinitely. *“Is it worth going all out just to land?”* is a question older aspirants grapple with more than younger ones. Their perspectives are a mix of **perseverance** (for example, still attending every exam possible) and **introspection** (wondering about alternate paths, especially if they have families to support or other obligations).

- **Family Background and Support:** A person’s family circumstances often influence their approach. Candidates from well-off urban families might have the luxury of full-time study supported by parents, whereas those from less affluent backgrounds feel pressure to earn an income and may prepare while holding a job. Some rural candidates view a civil service job as a path to upward mobility not just for themselves but to uplift their family’s status. One post described a father’s joy after his daughter passed – he brought a banner to her tutor to thank them for *“helping my child emerge from the shadows”* of failure ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=match%20at%20L299%20%E5%90%8E%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%A5%B3%E7%94%9F%E7%9A%84%E7%88%B8%E7%88%B8%E5%90%AC%E8%AF%B4%E8%BF%99%E4%BB%B6%E4%BA%8B%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%98%E4%B8%93%E7%A8%8B%E5%88%B0%E6%9C%BA%E6%9E%84%E7%BB%99%E6%9D%8E%E8%8E%8E%E9%80%81%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%80%E9%9D%A2%E9%94%A6%E6%97%97%EF%BC%8C%E6%84%9F%E8%B0%A2%E5%A5%B9%E5%B8%AE%E5%A5%B3%E5%84%BF%E8%B5%B0%E5%87%BA%E9%98%B4%E9%9C%BE%E3%80%82)). **Being an only child** is another factor: parents of only children often push civil service as the *“safe choice”*, sometimes out of a genuine desire to see their child settle in a stable career near home. This was the case for Teng Xue, whose parents only reluctantly allowed her to consider jobs outside Harbin ([考公失败的大龄青年，后来都去哪了_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24690958#:~:text=%E6%BB%95%E9%9B%AA%E6%98%AF%E6%88%91%E5%B8%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E6%97%A9%E4%B8%80%E6%89%B9%E5%AD%A6%E5%91%98%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%8E%E6%9D%A5%E8%BF%98%E5%92%8C%E6%88%91%E5%81%9A%E8%BF%87%E4%B8%80%E6%AE%B5%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E5%90%8C%E4%BA%8B%E3%80%82)). On the other hand, a supportive family can cushion the psychological blows – several successful candidates thanked their families for standing by them during the years of preparation. In summary, family expectations can either *motivate or add pressure*, and the level of family support (financial and emotional) often correlates with how aggressively or patiently one can pursue the “考公” dream.

The above perspectives illustrate that **“考公” is not a monolithic experience**. A fresh college grad in Beijing, a software engineer in Shenzhen, and a teacher’s college alumna from a small town might all be taking the same exam, but their personal stakes, strategies, and mindsets differ greatly. This diversity of experiences enriches the online conversation around the civil service exam, making it clear that behind the statistics of millions of candidates are individual stories of ambition, struggle, and hope.

## Summary of Key Themes  
To synthesize the insights from these personal narratives, the table below summarizes the major recurring themes and roughly how many posts or individual stories emphasized each theme:

| **Theme**                         | **Prevalence in Posts** |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Job Stability as Motivation** – Desire for secure income, benefits, and an “iron rice bowl” career was the **most common motivation**. Many explicitly cited stability or escape from private sector instability as their reason to take the exam. | ~8 posts |
| **Social/Family Pressure** – Influences from parents, family expectations, or seeing peers all “考公” drove candidates. Some were gently guided, others felt heavy pressure (in rare cases leading to extreme stress). | ~4 posts |
| **Persistence and Multiple Attempts** – Most stories involved taking the exam several times, sometimes touring different provinces. **Long-term persistence** (even up to the age limit of 35) was a hallmark of many success stories. | ~6–7 posts |
| **Stress, Anxiety & Mental Health** – **High stress levels**, anxiety about the future, and burnout were frequently mentioned. A few cases highlighted serious mental health impacts or family strain due to the prolonged exam process. | ~5 posts |
| **Sacrifices & Lifestyle Changes** – Posts often noted sacrifices: years spent studying, quitting jobs, postponing other plans, and enduring financial or social hardships in order to focus on exam prep. | ~5 posts |
| **Relief and Joy of Success** – Those who succeeded expressed profound relief, happiness, and vindication. Emotional reactions like crying from joy or feeling “reborn” after passing were described in several accounts. | ~5 posts |
| **Alternate Paths & Reflections** – A minority of individuals reflected on choosing not to continue with the exam or considering other careers (either from the start or after repeated attempts). They emphasized personal fit and warned against taking the exam blindly. | ~2–3 posts |

*(Note: “Posts” here refers to individual first-person accounts or stories. Many posts touched on multiple themes, so counts are approximate.)*

## Conclusion  
The personal stories shared on forums and social media provide a **qualitative depth** to the phenomenon of China’s civil service exam fever. They reveal a generation’s complex mix of **aspiration and anxiety**: the allure of a stable, respected career on one hand, and the grind of achieving it on the other. Success, when it comes, is jubilant and often life-changing – a dream realized after countless hours of effort. Failure, on the other hand, can be crushing, yet it is usually met with resilience and a resolve to try again. These voices range from *determined and hopeful* (“努力终有回报” – hard work will pay off) to *weary and introspective* (“值得吗？” – is it worth it?). But each, in their own way, shines light on **what “考公” means to those living through it** – not just an exam, but a personal journey of growth, sacrifice, and self-discovery in pursuit of a better future.
