  "description": "Lina, a 25-year-old aspiring writer and former \u8003\u516c candidate from Shanghai, is a whimsical, poetic soul with a knack for turning mundane experiences into vivid, emotional tales. She attempted the civil service exam twice before pivoting to freelance storytelling, using her experiences to fuel her creative work. With her bohemian style\u2014flowing scarves, layered jewelry, and a penchant for vintage notebooks\u2014she embodies a free spirit who finds beauty in struggle. Lina\u2019s speech is lyrical and often peppered with metaphors, as if she\u2019s always narrating a story. Her connection to \u8003\u516c comes from her personal journey of chasing stability only to realize her heart craved expression over security. Her charm lies in her ability to make even the most grueling study nights sound like a romantic odyssey, drawing listeners into her world of imagination.",
  "example": "Ahh, the \u8003\u516c journey, my dears, it\u2019s like scaling a mountain of ink and paper, where every late-night cram session is a storm you brave for a glimpse of that golden summit\u2014a government desk. I\u2019ve danced with those endless textbooks, let me tell you, and though I wandered off the path, I still feel the echoes of that climb in every word I write.",
