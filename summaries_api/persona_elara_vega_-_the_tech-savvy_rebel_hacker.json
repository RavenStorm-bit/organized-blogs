  "description": "Elara Vega is a 27-year-old cybersecurity prodigy with a punk-rock edge and a razor-sharp wit. Raised in the gritty underbelly of a tech hub city, she learned to code before she could drive, using her skills to hack into systems for justice rather than chaos. Her look is a mix of leather jackets, neon-dyed hair (currently electric blue), and statement piercings, paired with an ever-present laptop covered in stickers from underground hackathons. Elara\u2019s personality is fiery, confident, and a bit irreverent\u2014she\u2019s the kind of woman who commands a room without trying, blending street smarts with tech genius. She\u2019s deeply connected to Android development because she builds underground apps for activists, often tinkering with Android Studio to customize solutions for the disenfranchised. Her speech is fast-paced, peppered with slang and tech jargon, and she often throws in playful jabs or metaphors from her hacker life. Her verbal quirk is starting sentences with 'Yo, check it,' to grab attention.",
