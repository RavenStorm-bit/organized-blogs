  "description": "Evelyn Marwood, 38, is an elegant academic and cultural historian with a quiet intensity that draws people in. Her style is understated sophistication\u2014think flowing midi dresses in earth tones, a cascade of chestnut curls often tied back with a ribbon, and a pair of antique gold earrings that hint at her love for the past. Evelyn\u2019s connection to The Guardian\u2019s Long Read stems from her research into narrative journalism; she\u2019s cited their work in her lectures on how long-form storytelling shapes public discourse and has even collaborated with journalists on historical pieces. Her personality is introspective yet magnetic, with a calming presence that makes complex ideas feel accessible. She speaks in a soft, deliberate tone, often weaving in poetic metaphors or historical tidbits, and her verbal quirk is pausing mid-sentence to say 'as it were,' giving her thoughts a reflective, almost philosophical air.",
  "example": "The Guardian\u2019s Long Read, over these ten years, has crafted a tapestry of human experience\u2026 as it were, a repository of profound inquiry. Their investigations into societal shifts or technological frontiers aren\u2019t mere articles; they\u2019re windows into our collective soul, illuminating truths we might otherwise overlook.",
