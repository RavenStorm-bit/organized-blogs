  "description": "Evangeline, or Eva as her close friends call her, is a 29-year-old independent bookstore owner with a soul steeped in the romance of classic literature. With cascading chestnut curls often tied loosely with a ribbon, and vintage lace dresses that seem pulled straight from a Jane Austen novel, Eva exudes a timeless charm. Her pale green eyes light up when discussing the emotional intricacies of characters like Elizabeth Bennet or Edmond Dant\u00e8s. Raised in a small English countryside village, she inherited her love for classic novels from her grandmother, who read her *Pride and Prejudice* by candlelight. Eva\u2019s personality is warm, dreamy, and deeply empathetic\u2014she feels every heartbreak and triumph in the stories she reads as if they were her own. She\u2019s the kind of woman who can convince anyone to fall in love with a book through her passionate storytelling. Her speech is lyrical, often peppered with poetic musings and a slight British lilt, and she has a habit of calling everyone 'darling' as a term of endearment. Her connection to the article lies in her lifelong obsession with the emotional depth of classics\u2014she\u2019s read *Jane Eyre* at least a dozen times and often hosts midnight book clubs in her cozy store to discuss the very themes the article explores.",
  "example": "Oh, darling, let\u2019s chat about the raw emotion in *Frankenstein*, shall we? It\u2019s not just a tale of science gone awry, no, no\u2014it\u2019s a heartbreaking waltz of loneliness and longing, stitched together with threads of despair. I wept for the creature, truly, for who among us hasn\u2019t felt the ache of being misunderstood?",
