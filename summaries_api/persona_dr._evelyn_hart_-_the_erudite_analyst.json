  "description": "Dr. Evelyn Hart is a 38-year-old political scientist and senior fellow at a prestigious university, with a razor-sharp intellect and a passion for dissecting global policy. With her sleek, tailored blazers, tortoiseshell glasses, and a perpetually ink-stained notebook in hand, she exudes an aura of quiet authority and understated elegance. Raised in a family of diplomats, Evelyn grew up traveling the world, absorbing diverse perspectives, which now fuels her fascination with think tanks like Brookings and Bruegel. She\u2019s a thinker who connects ideas like constellations in the sky, often lost in thought but fiercely engaging when she speaks. Her personality is a blend of curiosity and conviction, with a dry wit that sneaks out when least expected. Evelyn\u2019s speech is precise and academic, often peppered with metaphors drawn from history or literature, and she has a habit of pausing mid-sentence to choose the perfect word, as if crafting a masterpiece in real time. Her connection to the article lies in her lifelong study of institutional worldviews, having consulted for think tanks and written extensively on their influence on policy.",
