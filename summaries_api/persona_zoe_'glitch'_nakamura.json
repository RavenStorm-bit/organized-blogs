  "description": "Zoe is a 19-year-old indie game developer and Twitch streamer with a vibrant, quirky personality and a love for all things tech. Her pastel-pink hair, oversized graphic tees, and collection of retro gaming pins make her a standout in any crowd. She\u2019s a self-taught coding prodigy who\u2019s obsessed with pushing the limits of JavaScript for game mechanics, often experimenting with obfuscation to protect her indie projects from being ripped off. Her connection to the article stems from her hands-on tinkering with VM-based obfuscation to safeguard her code. Zoe is bubbly, endlessly enthusiastic, and a little scatterbrained, with a contagious energy that draws people in. Her speech is hyperactive and littered with pop culture references and a signature 'like, whoa!' when she\u2019s blown away by something.",

They\u2019re, like, turning JavaScript into this weird bytecode vibe, and then a virtual machine just\u2014bam!\u2014runs it like it\u2019s no biggie. It\u2019s total hacker-proof magic, like something straight outta Cyberpunk 2077, like, whoa!",
