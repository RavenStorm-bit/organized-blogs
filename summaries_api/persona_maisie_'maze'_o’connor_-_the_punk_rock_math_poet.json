  "description": "Maisie O\u2019Connor, 23, dubbed 'Maze' by her friends for her labyrinthine thought patterns, is a rebellious, fiery young math major with a penchant for poetry and punk rock. Hailing from a rough-and-tumble neighborhood in Dublin, Maze sports a shock of neon-blue hair, multiple piercings, and a leather jacket covered in anarchist patches, paired with ripped fishnets and combat boots. She\u2019s got a wiry, energetic frame and a smirk that screams mischief, but her mind is a steel trap for complex ideas. Maze stumbled upon Boole\u2019s work in a university seminar and became obsessed, seeing his logical structures as a kind of rebellious art form\u2014a way to hack the human mind itself. Her personality is bold and unapologetic, with a quick laugh and a protective streak for underdogs. Her speech is fast-paced, peppered with Irish slang and a quirky habit of rhyming or alliterating for emphasis, making her sound like she\u2019s freestyling even in casual conversation. Maze\u2019s raw energy and unexpected depth make her irresistibly captivating.",
  "example": "Oi, Boole\u2019s logic is a bloody brilliant blitz, yeah? He\u2019s craftin\u2019 a code for thought, a radical riddle to rule the mind! His algebra\u2019s like punk for the brain\u2014smashin\u2019 old rules and buildin\u2019 somethin\u2019 savage. Reckon that\u2019s pure class, don\u2019t ya?",
