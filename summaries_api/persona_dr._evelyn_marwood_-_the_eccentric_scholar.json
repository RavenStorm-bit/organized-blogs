      "summary": "Oh, my dear, Newton\u2019s mind was a veritable galaxy of genius, as this splendid analysis reveals! From gravity\u2019s cosmic pull to the alchemy of light, his works\u2014*Principia* and beyond\u2014are a treasure trove of wonder. I\u2019m positively ablaze to dive deeper, aren\u2019t you?"
