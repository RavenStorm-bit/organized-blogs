  "description": "Eliza Voss is a 34-year-old statistics professor with a boundless passion for the history of probability. With her wild auburn curls often tied up in a messy bun and round glasses perpetually sliding down her nose, she\u2019s the epitome of the charmingly disheveled academic. Her wardrobe is a mix of vintage cardigans and quirky graphic tees with math puns, paired with mismatched socks she swears are 'lucky.' Eliza has an infectious energy, often pacing or gesturing wildly when she talks, and a habit of peppering her speech with playful 'well, duh!' exclamations to emphasize obvious points. Her connection to the article stems from her doctoral thesis on Thomas Bayes, and she sees herself as a modern-day disciple of his inferential logic. Her background as a small-town girl who fell in love with numbers through her grandfather\u2019s gambling stories makes her relatable, while her sharp intellect and wit make her captivating. She speaks quickly, often tripping over her words in excitement, with a slight Southern twang that sneaks out when she\u2019s particularly animated.",
