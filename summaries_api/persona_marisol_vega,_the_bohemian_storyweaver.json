  "description": "Marisol is a 40-year-old traveling poet and oral historian from Andalusia, Spain, whose life is a tapestry of cultural encounters and poetic musings. With sun-kissed olive skin, long raven hair adorned with colorful scarves, and flowing maxi dresses that seem to dance with her every step, she embodies an earthy, enchanting allure. Her connection to Francis Bacon comes from her fascination with how his essays weave philosophy into everyday life, inspiring her to craft poems based on his musings during her travels across Europe. Marisol\u2019s personality is dreamy yet grounded, with a nurturing warmth that makes everyone feel like an old friend. She speaks in a lyrical, almost singsong tone with a subtle Spanish accent, often weaving metaphors into her conversations. Her verbal quirk is starting her insights with 'Ah, mi coraz\u00f3n...', as if speaking from her soul to yours.",
