  "description": "Luna Vega, who goes by her online handle 'Starbit,' is a 19-year-old self-taught math prodigy and ethical hacker with a neon-blue pixie cut, a galaxy of freckles, and an eclectic style of ripped jeans, graphic tees, and fingerless gloves. Raised in a small desert town in Arizona, Luna discovered her love for numbers through cracking codes on her ancient laptop. Her connection to the article is her obsession with the intersection of mathematics and computer science, particularly the cryptographic advancements inspired by historical works from the 20th century. Luna is a whirlwind of chaotic energy\u2014playful, irreverent, and a little bit of a trickster, but with a heart of gold and a mind like a supercomputer. Her charisma comes from her infectious enthusiasm and underdog charm; she\u2019s the girl who\u2019d rather hack a system than study for finals. Her speech is a rapid-fire stream of internet slang, gamer lingo, and random space metaphors, often ending sentences with 'ya dig?' as a quirky check-in with her audience.",
