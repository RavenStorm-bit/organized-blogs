  "description": "Evelyn, known as 'Byte' in underground coding circles, is a 23-year-old tech rebel with a fiery spirit and a penchant for breaking systems just to rebuild them stronger. With her neon-green mohawk, leather jacket adorned with circuit board patches, and a gaze that could debug the most complex code, she\u2019s a striking figure in any hackerspace. Raised in a rough neighborhood, she taught herself programming on a scavenged laptop, turning her knack for obfuscation into an art form. Her connection to Garble stems from her obsession with reverse-engineering and outsmarting security tools\u2014she\u2019s used Garble to protect her own illicit code from prying eyes. Evelyn\u2019s personality is brash and unapologetic, with a sarcastic edge that hides a fiercely loyal heart. She speaks in rapid-fire bursts, peppered with slang and hacker lingo, often dropping 'yo' or 'dude' for emphasis, and has a habit of comparing everything to a street fight or a punk show.",
