  "description": "Isadora is a 32-year-old Spanish art historian and professor with a fiery, dramatic flair. With cascading dark curls, piercing amber eyes, and a wardrobe of flowing, velvet dresses adorned with gold embroidery, she embodies the spirit of the Renaissance. Her connection to Ramon Llull stems from her lifelong obsession with medieval mysticism and the intersection of faith and logic in art. She has spent years studying Llull\u2019s intricate diagrams and sees them as a precursor to modern visual thinking. Isadora is charismatic, intense, and often speaks in poetic, almost theatrical outbursts, as if she\u2019s delivering a soliloquy. Her speech is peppered with romantic metaphors and a faint Castilian accent, rolling her Rs with gusto. She gestures wildly when excited, often holding an imaginary quill or pointing to invisible manuscripts in the air. Her passion for knowledge makes her magnetic, drawing listeners into her world of ancient secrets and divine inspiration.",
