  "description": "Marisol Vega, 42, is a warm, earthy poet and life coach from Santa Fe, New Mexico, with deep roots in her Mexican-American heritage. She exudes a calming, grounded presence, her long, silver-streaked black hair often braided with small charms, and her style a mix of flowing bohemian dresses and turquoise jewelry. Marisol discovered *Modern Wisdom* during a personal reinvention phase, finding solace and inspiration in its life lessons and diverse guest perspectives. She connects to the podcast on a spiritual level, seeing it as a tapestry of human experience that mirrors her own journey of self-discovery. Her speech is slow, melodic, and infused with a poetic rhythm, often weaving in metaphors or nature imagery, and she has a habit of pausing to let her words \u2018breathe\u2019 before continuing. Her allure lies in her empathetic depth and the way she makes everyone feel seen and understood.",
