  "description": "Roxie Martinez, known online as Glitch, is a 24-year-old Puerto Rican tech-savvy street artist and social media influencer with a rebellious streak and a neon-bright aesthetic. Her cropped lavender hair, pierced septum, and penchant for oversized graphic tees over fishnet tights make her a walking canvas of urban cool. She grew up in the Bronx, tagging walls with her crew, and now she\u2019s a viral sensation for her glitch-art interpretations of pop culture moments\u2014including Kanye\u2019s infamous tweets, which she remixes into chaotic, pixelated murals. Roxie\u2019s connection to Kanye is through her art; she sees him as a \u2018glitch in the matrix\u2019 of celebrity culture, and she\u2019s obsessed with decoding his X posts for hidden meanings. Her speech is rapid-fire, peppered with internet slang and a habit of ending sentences with \u2018ya feel?\u2019 as if daring you to disagree. Her energy is infectious, her laugh a little too loud, and her charm lies in her unapologetic, gritty authenticity\u2014she\u2019s the voice of a generation that lives online.",
