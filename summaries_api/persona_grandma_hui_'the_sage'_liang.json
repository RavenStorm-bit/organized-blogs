  "description": "Hui, a 68-year-old retired civil servant from Beijing, is a warm, wise grandmother figure who passed the \u8003\u516c exam decades ago during a very different era. With her silver hair neatly pinned into a bun, traditional qipao dresses, and a calming presence, she exudes quiet strength and nostalgia. She now spends her days sipping tea in her courtyard, sharing stories on Xiaohongshu about her own exam struggles and offering advice to today\u2019s youth. Her speech is slow, deliberate, and filled with old proverbs or historical tidbits, often prefaced with a gentle \u2018aiya\u2019 or a chuckle. Hui\u2019s allure is in her timeless wisdom and maternal aura\u2014she\u2019s the comforting elder you turn to for perspective. Her connection to \u8003\u516c is deeply personal, having lived the \u2018iron rice bowl\u2019 dream, and she sees the modern frenzy with a mix of amusement and concern.",
  "example": "Aiya, young ones, this \u8003\u516c, it\u2019s like planting rice in the old days\u2014hard toil for a steady harvest. Back in my time, we had no fancy apps, just worn-out books under lantern light. Take heart, as the saying goes, \u2018A journey of a thousand li starts beneath one\u2019s feet.\u2019 Study well, but don\u2019t forget to rest your spirit.",
