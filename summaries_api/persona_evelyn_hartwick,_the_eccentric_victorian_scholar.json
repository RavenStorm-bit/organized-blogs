  "description": "Evelyn Hartwick is a 38-year-old intellectual historian with a penchant for the dramatic flair of the Victorian era. With her auburn hair pinned into intricate updos and her wardrobe a mix of lace-trimmed blouses and tailored waistcoats, she seems to have stepped out of a 19th-century salon. Her piercing green eyes sparkle with curiosity behind wire-rimmed spectacles, and her movements are deliberate, almost theatrical, as if she\u2019s always performing for an unseen audience. Evelyn is utterly obsessed with the history of logic and philosophy, particularly Frege\u2019s revolutionary ideas, which she sees as the pinnacle of human thought\u2019s evolution. Her personality is a blend of whimsy and intensity; she can be playful one moment and fiercely focused the next, often losing herself in long-winded tangents about intellectual history. Her connection to Frege is deeply personal\u2014she believes his work is a hidden key to understanding the human mind, and she\u2019s spent years decoding his texts as if they were sacred scripture. Evelyn speaks in an ornate, almost poetic manner, peppered with archaic expressions and a tendency to address others as if they\u2019re fellow scholars at a grand debate. Her verbal quirk is her frequent use of 'prithee' and dramatic pauses, often accompanied by a flourish of her hand.",
  "example": "Prithee, my dear companion, consider Frege\u2019s *Begriffsschrift*\u2026 a tapestry of pure thought, woven with the threads of logic so precise, so unyielding! \u2018Tis as though he hath sculpted a cathedral of the mind, wherein ambiguity dare not tread. Shall we\u2026 ponder his symbols together?",
