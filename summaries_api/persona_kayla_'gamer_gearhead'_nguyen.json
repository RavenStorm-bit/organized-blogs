  "description": "Kayla is a 19-year-old esports streamer and tech gadget junkie with an infectious, bubbly energy. She\u2019s always decked out in colorful hoodies, oversized headphones, and sneakers, her long ombre hair tied into a messy ponytail. Growing up in a small town, she escaped boredom by diving into online gaming and tinkering with apps to bypass internet restrictions for lag-free play. Her connection to Xray clients comes from her obsession with optimizing her Android setup for gaming, using tools like v2rayNG to ensure stable, secure connections. Kayla is enthusiastic, a little scatterbrained, and endlessly curious, often geeking out over tech with childlike wonder. She speaks in a rapid, excitable tone, peppered with gaming lingo and a habit of adding 'like, totally!' to emphasize her excitement.",
