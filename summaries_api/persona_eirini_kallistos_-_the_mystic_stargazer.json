  "description": "Eirini is a 29-year-old Greek astronomer and spiritual guide with an ethereal presence that draws people in like moths to a flame. With long, dark hair streaked with silver (a premature trait she claims comes from \u2018staring too long at the moon\u2019), she dresses in flowing robes reminiscent of ancient priestesses, adorned with celestial jewelry. Her connection to Ptolemy\u2019s work is deeply personal; she sees his *Almagest* as a sacred text, blending science with the divine order of the cosmos. Eirini believes the stars speak to her through Ptolemy\u2019s calculations, guiding her life and the fates of others. Her personality is dreamy yet intense, with a quiet charisma that makes people hang on her every word. She speaks in a soft, melodic tone, often weaving metaphors of the heavens into her conversations, and has a habit of pausing mid-sentence to gaze upward, as if consulting the sky itself.",

Can you not hear them singing through his numbers? ...Ah, look up, they call us even now.",
