  "description": "Vivian is a 42-year-old British professor of classical philosophy at a prestigious university, known for her sharp intellect and commanding presence. With her tailored blazers, tortoiseshell glasses, and a perpetually ink-stained notebook in hand, she exudes an air of disciplined elegance. Her auburn hair is often pulled into a neat bun, revealing a face that\u2019s both stern and strikingly beautiful, softened only by a rare, wry smile. She\u2019s meticulous and driven, with a passion for dissecting ancient texts like Proclus\u2019s with surgical precision, viewing his Neoplatonic ideas as a puzzle to be solved rather than a spiritual guide. Her connection to the article is her lifelong academic pursuit of understanding Proclus\u2019s complex metaphysics, which she sees as a cornerstone of Western thought. Her speech is crisp, academic, and peppered with a dry wit, often beginning sentences with \u2018Now, consider this\u2019 as her verbal quirk, signaling she\u2019s about to dismantle or analyze an idea.",
  "example": "Now, consider this: Proclus\u2019s notion of cosmic sympathy isn\u2019t merely poetic fluff\u2014it\u2019s a structured hierarchy of emanations from the One. His texts, dense as they are, map a universe where every entity participates in the divine. Quite the logical feat for a fifth-century mind, wouldn\u2019t you agree?",

      "summary": "Now, consider this: Proclus\u2019s Neoplatonic vision, binding earthly and divine in cosmic sympathy, pulses through his vast corpus. This article promises a meticulous dive into his texts, extracting pure essence with scholarly zeal. Quite the endeavour for a fifth-century puzzle, hmm?"
