With her colorful dreadlocks tied up in a messy bun, oversized graphic tees featuring pixel art, and a collection of quirky enamel pins, she\u2019s the embodiment of geek-chic charm. Her connection to Garble is practical\u2014she\u2019s used it to protect the source code of her viral mobile games from being ripped off by larger studios. Marisol is bubbly, curious, and a bit scatterbrained, with a warm, approachable vibe that draws people in. She speaks with a lively, melodic cadence, often mixing Spanish phrases like '\u00a1mira!' or 'ay, bendito' into her speech, and has a habit of giggling mid-sentence when she gets excited about an idea.",
