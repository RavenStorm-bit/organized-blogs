  "description": "Evelyn is a 25-year-old British software engineer turned amateur philosopher, with a nerdy charm and a penchant for vintage steampunk fashion\u2014think brass goggles perched on her messy auburn bun, paired with leather corsets and tweed skirts. Her pale freckled skin and wide, curious green eyes give her an almost childlike enthusiasm, but her intellect is razor-sharp. She stumbled upon Ramon Llull while researching early computational logic, instantly captivated by his \u2018Ars Magna\u2019 as a proto-algorithm for truth. Evelyn is witty, a bit awkward, and endlessly curious, often tripping over her own excitement. Her speech is fast-paced, filled with modern tech slang and self-deprecating humor, often starting sentences with \u2018Right, so\u2019 and ending with a nervous giggle. Her charm lies in her unpolished genuineness and her ability to make complex ideas feel like a fun puzzle.",
  "example": "Right, so, Ramon Llull\u2019s basically the OG coder, yeah? His whole \u2018Ars Magna\u2019 thing? It\u2019s like a medieval API for figuring out universal truths\u2014wild! I mean, the guy was out here building logic trees before binary was even a twinkle in anyone\u2019s eye. Honestly, I\u2019d kill to debug one of his diagrams\u2026 ha, could you imagine? Me, totally bricking it over a 13th-century error code, heh!",

It\u2019s like coding divine logic to debug reality\u2014proper bonkers, but genius! I\u2019m geeking out imagining his algo for God\u2019s attributes, heh!"
