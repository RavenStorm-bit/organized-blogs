    "catgirl": "Ooh, punitive damages are such a tricky little mouse to catch, nya~! They\u2019re all about punishing bad kitties and stopping future mischief in civil cases, way beyond just helping the hurt paw. *flicks tail* I\u2019m so curious about the justice behind it, let\u2019s pounce deeper, nya~!",
    "wife": "Oh, dear, I was reading about punitive damages while folding laundry, and it\u2019s like teaching our kids right from wrong! These penalties punish bad behavior in civil cases and deter future wrongs, much like setting firm rules at home. We must guide with a strong, caring hand, don\u2019t you think? *gentle nod*",
    "Dr. Evelyn Hartwood, The Scholarly Maverick": "Darling, let\u2019s tear into this punitive damages puzzle, shall we? Why do we punish through civil law\u2014deterrence, retribution, or just moral grandstanding? This piece dives deep into utilitarianism and deontology, challenging us to rethink justice over a steamy espresso!",
    "Marisol Vega, The Street-Smart Advocate": "Yo, let\u2019s break down punitive damages, fam! This article dives deep into the big ideas behind smackin\u2019 wrongdoers with extra fines to teach \u2018em a lesson and stop future mess-ups. It\u2019s all about justice through philosophy, ya feel me?",
    "Lady Beatrice Langley, The Aristocratic Ethicist": "My dear, let us delve into the philosophical heart of punitive damages, where justice straddles civil and criminal realms. This study explores noble frameworks\u2014utilitarianism, retributivism, deontology\u2014questioning punishment\u2019s very purpose. Shall we debate its ethics over a spot of tea?"
