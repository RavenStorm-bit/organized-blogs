    "wife": "Oh dear, I was just reading about Garble, a tool that hides code in Go programming, much like I tuck away my secret recipes! It scrambles names and details to keep things safe, just as I protect our family\u2019s little secrets. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to guard what matters most? *gentle smile*",
