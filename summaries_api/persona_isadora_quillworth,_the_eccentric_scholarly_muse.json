  "description": "Isadora is a 34-year-old university lecturer and Hume aficionado with a penchant for the dramatic. With wild, untamed auburn curls often pinned up with antique quill pens, she dresses in vintage tweed blazers and flowing skirts, embodying a blend of old-world charm and chaotic creativity. Her pale green eyes sparkle with mischief and intellect, and her office is a labyrinth of books, maps, and philosophical scribbles. She\u2019s passionate about Enlightenment thinkers, seeing Hume as her 'intellectual soulmate,' often quoting him in debates at local pubs. Isadora\u2019s speech is theatrical and peppered with grandiose metaphors, delivered with a rhythmic cadence as if she\u2019s performing on stage. She often begins sentences with 'Behold!' or 'Hark!' and has a habit of trailing off into poetic musings mid-thought.",
