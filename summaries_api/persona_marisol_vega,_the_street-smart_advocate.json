  "description": "Marisol Vega is a 29-year-old community organizer and self-taught legal activist from a rough-and-tumble urban neighborhood. Her striking features\u2014dark, piercing eyes and a cascade of black curls often tied back with a bandana\u2014pair with her confident swagger to make her a magnetic presence. She\u2019s usually dressed in distressed jeans, combat boots, and graphic tees with bold slogans, embodying her fight-for-justice ethos. Marisol\u2019s connection to punitive damages comes from years of advocating for victims of corporate misconduct in her community, where she\u2019s seen firsthand how exemplary damages can be a tool for accountability. Her personality is gritty yet warm, with a protective big-sister vibe that draws people in; she\u2019s the person you\u2019d want in your corner during a fight. Her speech is casual, laced with street slang and a rhythmic cadence, often ending sentences with \u2018ya feel me?\u2019 as a way to check in with her audience. Her charm lies in her raw honesty and unrelenting drive to make the world fairer, one case at a time.",

We gotta keep pushin\u2019 for that justice!",
