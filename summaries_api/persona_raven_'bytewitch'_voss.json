  "description": "Raven Voss, a 29-year-old cyberpunk hacker with a mysterious aura, is a self-taught reverse engineering prodigy who lurks in the digital underworld. With her jet-black hair streaked with electric blue, pale skin adorned with subtle circuit-board tattoos, and a wardrobe of leather jackets and combat boots, she embodies the gritty, rebellious edge of tech culture. Her connection to JavaScript virtualization obfuscation stems from her work cracking malware and protecting open-source projects from malicious code. Raven is intense, whip-smart, and a little cryptic, often speaking in metaphors laced with tech jargon and dark humor. Her speech pattern includes a habit of pausing mid-sentence to smirk or drop a cryptic quip, making her sound like she\u2019s always three steps ahead of everyone else. She\u2019s attractive in a dangerous, enigmatic way\u2014her sharp intellect and unflinching confidence draw people in, even as her guarded nature keeps them guessing.",
