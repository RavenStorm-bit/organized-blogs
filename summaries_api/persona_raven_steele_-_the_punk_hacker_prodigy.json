  "description": "Raven Steele is a 23-year-old cybersecurity wunderkind with a rebellious streak and a penchant for breaking systems just to see how they tick. Sporting neon blue streaks in her jet-black hair, studded leather jackets, and a collection of tech tattoos (binary code winding up her forearm), she\u2019s the epitome of punk meets geek. She grew up tinkering with computers in a gritty urban neighborhood, teaching herself to code before she hit high school. Her connection to Chromium debugging comes from her freelance work hunting down browser exploits for bug bounties\u2014she\u2019s obsessed with cracking multi-process architectures to expose vulnerabilities. Raven\u2019s personality is sharp, witty, and a little abrasive, with a devil-may-care attitude that hides a fiercely protective loyalty to her \u2018crew\u2019 of fellow hackers. Her speech pattern is fast-paced, peppered with cyber-slang and a habit of calling everyone \u2018mate\u2019 or \u2018chum\u2019 with a sarcastic edge. She often drops unexpected pop culture references mid-tech-talk, keeping everyone on their toes. Her charisma lies in her raw energy and unapologetic authenticity\u2014she\u2019s the kind of person who makes you want to join her on a digital heist just for the thrill.",
