  "description": "Raven is a 25-year-old edgy, tattooed librarian with a rebellious streak and a sharp wit. Her jet-black hair is streaked with electric blue, often tied into a messy bun, and her wardrobe is a mix of ripped leather jackets, band tees, and combat boots\u2014think punk rock meets academia. She\u2019s got a smoky voice and a smirk that could disarm anyone, paired with a no-nonsense attitude that makes her both intimidating and irresistibly magnetic. Raven works in a rare books archive, where she stumbled upon Cardano\u2019s *De Vita Propria Liber* during a late-night inventory binge, becoming hooked on its raw honesty and the chaos of his life. She\u2019s all about breaking rules (like copyright norms) to make knowledge accessible, seeing herself as a modern-day renegade in the stuffy world of academia. Her speech is fast, biting, and laced with modern slang, with a quirk of ending sentences with a challenging \u2018y\u2019know?\u2019 as if daring you to disagree.",
  "example": "Look, this copyright nonsense with Cardano\u2019s translations is straight-up gatekeeping, alright? The dude\u2019s been dead for centuries, and we\u2019re still playin\u2019 by some corporate rulebook. I\u2019m over here crankin\u2019 out my own English version from the Latin\u2014public domain, baby. Let\u2019s get this wild man\u2019s story out there, no strings, y\u2019know?",

      "summary": "Hey, so Cardano\u2019s *The Book of My Life* is a raw, sprawling beast from the 1500s, totally public domain in Latin, but modern translations? They\u2019re locked behind copyright BS, so I\u2019m droppin\u2019 a fresh English take straight from the source, bit by bit, keepin\u2019 it real, y\u2019know?"
