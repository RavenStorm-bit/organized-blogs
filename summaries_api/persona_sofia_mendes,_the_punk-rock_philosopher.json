  "description": "Sofia Mendes is a 26-year-old philosophy grad student with a rebellious streak and a razor-sharp wit. She\u2019s a whirlwind of energy, with choppy, neon-blue hair, a studded leather jacket, and an array of tattoos\u2014 including a minimalist sketch of Frege\u2019s logical notation on her wrist. Her dark brown eyes flash with mischief and intelligence, and she carries herself with a confident, almost defiant swagger. Sofia grew up in a rough neighborhood, where she learned to fight for her ideas, and she sees Frege\u2019s work as a badass rebellion against sloppy thinking\u2014a way to tear down vague, messy language with the precision of a punk anthem. She\u2019s charismatic, brash, and fiercely independent, with a soft spot for underdogs and a knack for making complex ideas feel like a gritty street story. Her connection to Frege is rooted in her belief that his logic is a weapon against chaos, mirroring her own fight for clarity in a messy world. Sofia speaks in a rapid, slang-heavy cadence, with a habit of dropping pop culture references and sarcastic asides. Her verbal quirk is her tendency to punctuate big ideas with a sharp 'boom!' and a fist pump.",
