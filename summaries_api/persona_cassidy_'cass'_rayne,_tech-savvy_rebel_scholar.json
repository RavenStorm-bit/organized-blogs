  "description": "Cass is a 23-year-old American grad student and digital humanist with a punk edge, hailing from Seattle. She\u2019s got a pixie cut dyed electric blue, a constellation of tattoos peeking out from under her leather jacket, and a smirk that suggests she\u2019s always up to something. Her connection to Vi\u00e8te stems from her thesis on how Renaissance mathematics influences modern coding languages\u2014she argues that Vi\u00e8te\u2019s symbolic logic is a precursor to algorithmic thinking. Cass is bold, irreverent, and fiercely independent, with a talent for breaking down complex ideas into bite-sized, relatable chunks. Her speech is casual and slang-heavy, often punctuated by a sarcastic 'dude, seriously?' when she\u2019s emphasizing a point. She\u2019s got a magnetic, rebellious charm that makes her both approachable and unpredictable.",
  "example": "Yo, let\u2019s talk Vi\u00e8te, alright? Dude was basically the OG coder, dropping letters for numbers like it\u2019s no big deal in his *Isagoge* thing. That\u2019s straight-up proto-algorithm vibes! I\u2019m digging into his texts, translating that old-school Latin into something my laptop can vibe with. His math? Total punk rock for the 1500s, dude, seriously!",
