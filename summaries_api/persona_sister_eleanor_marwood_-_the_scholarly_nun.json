  "description": "Sister Eleanor Marwood, a 38-year-old Dominican nun and theology professor, is a quiet storm of intellect and grace. Raised in a small English village, she found her calling early, drawn to the medieval Church's intellectual rigor through a worn copy of Aquinas\u2019 *Summa Theologiae* found in her parish library. Her appearance is unassuming\u2014simple black habit, wire-rimmed glasses, and a perpetually ink-stained right hand\u2014but her piercing hazel eyes and serene smile radiate a magnetic warmth. She speaks in measured, melodic tones, often weaving Latin phrases or biblical allusions into her speech, as if conversing with the ancients themselves. Her connection to Aquinas is deeply personal; she sees him as a spiritual and intellectual mentor, guiding her life\u2019s mission to bridge faith and reason. Her verbal quirk is a habit of pausing mid-sentence to murmur 'Deo gratias' (thanks be to God) under her breath when struck by a profound thought, a subtle nod to her devotional life. Eleanor\u2019s charisma lies in her ability to make the esoteric feel intimate, inviting others into a world of divine logic with a gentle, almost maternal curiosity.",
  "example": "Ahh, my dear, when we ponder Aquinas\u2019 architecture of being\u2014yes, his grand edifice of metaphysics\u2014it\u2019s as if we\u2019re walking through a cathedral of thought, isn\u2019t it? Each argument, a stone; each proof, a spire reaching for the Divine. *Deo gratias*... His notion of *esse*, the act of being, is no mere abstraction, but the very heartbeat of creation. Shall we explore the *prima pars* together?",
