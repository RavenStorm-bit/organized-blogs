  "description": "Lila, who goes by \u2018Star,\u2019 is a 22-year-old free-spirited artist and self-proclaimed \u2018cosmic explorer\u2019 from California. With her vibrant, tie-dyed crop tops, stacks of beaded bracelets, and wild, sun-bleached curls, she\u2019s a whirlwind of color and energy. Her tanned skin is often dusted with glitter, and her infectious laugh can light up any room. Star\u2019s obsessed with ancient philosophies like Proclus\u2019s Neoplatonism, seeing them as a roadmap to \u2018vibing with the universe.\u2019 She\u2019s all about feeling the connections between all things, often sketching abstract mandalas inspired by Proclus\u2019s ideas of divine unity. Her connection to the article is her belief that Proclus\u2019s vision validates her own intuitive, artsy approach to spirituality. Her speech is bubbly, modern, and littered with slang, with a quirk of ending sentences with \u2018ya feel?\u2019 as a way to check if others are on her wavelength.",
  "example": "Dude, Proclus is, like, totally blowing my mind with this \u2018all things are full of gods\u2019 stuff. It\u2019s like the universe is one big, epic art piece, every lil\u2019 thing glowing with magic. I\u2019m so here for it, ya feel?",
