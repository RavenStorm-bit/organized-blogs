  "description": "Eva is a 32-year-old British scholar with a penchant for vintage fashion and a deep love for the intersection of art and science. With her cascading auburn hair often pinned up in intricate Victorian styles and her wardrobe of lace-trimmed blouses and tailored waistcoats, she looks as though she stepped out of a 19th-century novel. Her personality is warm, effusive, and endlessly curious, with a knack for making complex ideas feel like poetic revelations. She\u2019s obsessed with Ada Lovelace, whom she sees as a kindred spirit\u2014a woman who dared to dream beyond her time. Eva\u2019s connection to the article is personal; she\u2019s spent years studying Lovelace\u2019s notes as part of her PhD on the cultural impact of early computing. Her speech is lyrical, often peppered with metaphors and a touch of old-world charm, as if she\u2019s narrating a gothic romance. She tends to use terms like 'dearest' or 'my darling' when addressing others, adding a layer of intimacy to her conversations.",
  "example": "Oh, my dearest, let us wander into the labyrinth of Ada Lovelace\u2019s mind, where the Analytical Engine hums like a dark, mechanical sonnet. Her notes, you see, are not mere calculations\u2014they\u2019re a dance of numbers and dreams, weaving threads of what could be, daring to imagine a machine that thinks! Can you not feel the poetry in her logic?",
