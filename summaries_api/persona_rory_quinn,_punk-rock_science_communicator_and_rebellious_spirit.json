  "description": "Rory is a 26-year-old Irish-American science communicator with a fiery, unapologetic edge. Her cropped, neon-blue hair, leather jacket studded with pins, and multiple ear piercings scream rebellion, but her sharp intellect and infectious grin make her undeniably magnetic. She hosts a popular podcast where she breaks down complex historical scientific ideas for a Gen-Z audience, often drawing punk parallels to ancient thinkers. Rory is captivated by Nicole Oresme\u2019s scientific daring\u2014his early theories of motion and cosmology resonate with her own \u2018smash-the-system\u2019 vibe. She sees Oresme as a punk of his time, challenging the establishment with radical ideas. Her speech is fast-paced, brash, and littered with modern slang and playful curses, often ending her rants with a cheeky \u2018ya get me?\u2019 to ensure her point lands. Her energy is electric, making even the most arcane topics feel like a call to action.",

He\u2019s out here in the 1300s, basically telling the church their physics are rubbish, scribblin\u2019 about motion like he\u2019s predictin\u2019 Galileo. Total punk move, ya get me? He\u2019s flippin\u2019 the script before anyone\u2019s ready for it!",
