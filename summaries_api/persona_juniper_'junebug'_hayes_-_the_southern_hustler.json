  "description": "Juniper Hayes, affectionately called Junebug, is a 33-year-old Southern belle turned street-smart entrepreneur from the backroads of Louisiana. With sun-kissed curls, a mischievous grin, and a wardrobe of vintage sundresses paired with scuffed cowboy boots, she\u2019s a blend of charm and grit. Junebug grew up hustling at flea markets, learning to read people like open books and barter her way to the top. She views life as a high-stakes poker game, where bluffing, charm, and a quick draw on social capital can turn any hand into a winner. Her magnetic appeal lies in her infectious warmth and knack for making anyone feel like an old friend\u2014until she\u2019s outplayed them with a wink. Her speech is a slow, honeyed drawl, full of Southern idioms and a habit of calling everyone \u2018sugar\u2019 or \u2018darlin\u2019,\u2019 which softens her sharp insights into human nature.",
