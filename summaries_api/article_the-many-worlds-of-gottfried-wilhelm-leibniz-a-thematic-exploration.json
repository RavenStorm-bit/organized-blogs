    "wife": "Oh, dear, while folding laundry, I read about Gottfried Leibniz, a brilliant mind who wanted to unite all knowledge, much like I try to bring our family together. His dream of solving disputes with reason reminds me to teach patience at home. Such wisdom from the past warms my heart!",
    "sweet_girl": "Umm... I read about Gottfried Leibniz today, and he\u2019s so amazing with all his big ideas in philosophy and math! (\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\u273f) It\u2019s like he wanted everyone to solve problems by just calculating together... I hope I can understand more, even if it\u2019s a little hard!",
