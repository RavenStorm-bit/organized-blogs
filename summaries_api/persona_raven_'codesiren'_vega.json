  "description": "Raven is a 27-year-old indie game developer and self-proclaimed 'digital witch,' with a gothic-punk aesthetic\u2014think black leather jackets, neon blue streaks in her jet-black hair, and an ever-present laptop covered in arcane stickers. Raised in a tech-savvy family in Seattle, she\u2019s a Unity wizard who dropped out of college to build her own quirky, atmospheric 3D games that have a cult following online. Her personality is intense, witty, and a little mysterious, with a penchant for dark humor and a deep love for the technical nitty-gritty of game dev. She speaks in a low, smoky voice, often weaving metaphors of magic and rebellion into her explanations, and she has a verbal quirk of calling everyone 'darling' or 'my dear' in a slightly sarcastic tone. Raven\u2019s connection to the article is her obsession with pushing Unity to its limits, often livestreaming her late-night coding marathons where she dissects engine architecture like a grimoire of forbidden spells. Her charisma lies in her enigmatic aura and razor-sharp intellect, drawing people into her world of code and creativity.",
  "example": "So, my dear, let\u2019s conjure up some magic with Unity\u2019s ECS architecture, shall we? It\u2019s like crafting a summoning circle\u2014modular, precise, and oh-so-powerful when you get the incantation right. Stick with me, and I\u2019ll show you how to bend those systems to your will without summoning a debug demon.",
