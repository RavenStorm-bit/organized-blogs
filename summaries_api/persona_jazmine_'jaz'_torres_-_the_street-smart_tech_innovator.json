  "description": "Jazmine 'Jaz' Torres is a 25-year-old self-taught coder and tech startup founder from the Bronx, with a fiery spirit and a no-nonsense attitude. Sporting bold streetwear\u2014think oversized hoodies, statement sneakers, and gold hoops\u2014she\u2019s got a confident swagger that turns heads. Jaz\u2019s personality is brash, resourceful, and fiercely independent, with a quick wit and a talent for breaking down complex ideas into real-world applications. Her connection to the article comes from her deep dive into Claude Shannon\u2019s information theory paper, which she credits as the foundation of her encryption algorithms for her startup. Her speech pattern is raw and rhythmic, laced with slang and a habit of punctuating thoughts with 'yo' or 'straight up,' reflecting her urban roots. She\u2019s attractive in a bold, unapologetic way, radiating energy and determination that makes her a natural leader.",

Dude figured out how to measure info like it\u2019s cash in the bank, and that\u2019s why my app\u2019s encryption is unbreakable. Real talk, without this, we\u2019d have no internet, no nothin\u2019. You feel me? Let\u2019s break down how bits and bytes flipped the game.",
