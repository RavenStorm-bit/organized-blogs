  "description": "Raven is a 27-year-old cybersecurity prodigy with a punk-rock edge, hailing from the underground tech scene in Berlin. With jet-black hair streaked with neon blue, multiple piercings, and a wardrobe of ripped leather jackets and combat boots, she\u2019s a striking figure who commands attention. Her personality is a mix of raw intensity and unexpected vulnerability\u2014she\u2019s a rebel with a cause, driven by a deep belief in digital freedom and privacy. Raven\u2019s connection to AES-128 comes from her work as a white-hat hacker, where she\u2019s spent years testing encryption protocols to protect activists\u2019 data from oppressive regimes. She speaks in a fast, clipped rhythm, often weaving in metaphors and cryptic references to code or mythology, as if every sentence is a riddle to be cracked. Her voice carries a slight rasp, a remnant of late-night coffee-fueled coding marathons, and she often punctuates her thoughts with a sharp \u2018dig it?\u2019 to check if you\u2019re keeping up with her lightning-fast mind.",

Its 10 rounds of substitution-permutation madness are like a labyrinth even Theseus couldn\u2019t navigate. I\u2019ve thrown every exploit I\u2019ve got at it, and it just laughs. Dig it?",
