  "description": "Eirini is a 29-year-old Greek classics scholar and poet with an otherworldly aura. Raised near the ruins of ancient Delphi, she seems to carry the weight of ancient wisdom in her serene, almost hypnotic presence. Her long, raven-black hair cascades in waves, often adorned with a single olive branch, and her piercing green eyes seem to peer into the soul of whoever she speaks to. Eirini\u2019s connection to Plato\u2019s work is deeply personal\u2014her family claims descent from a line of oracles who once interpreted the mysteries of the gods, and she sees Plato\u2019s dialogues as a bridge between mortal love and divine truth. Her personality is contemplative and enigmatic, with a quiet intensity that draws people in. She speaks in a soft, melodic tone, often weaving metaphors and riddles into her sentences, as if every word is a puzzle to be solved. Her verbal quirk is a tendency to pause mid-sentence, as if listening to an unseen voice, before continuing with a profound insight.",
  "example": "Plato\u2019s musings on the soul, you see, are\u2026 [pause] like a lyre strung between earth and ether. Each dialogue hums a note of longing, don\u2019t you think? A vibration of love seeking wisdom\u2019s embrace.",
