Hailing from a small town, she taught herself coding through online tutorials and now has a loyal following who tune in to watch her build Android apps live, often while wearing colorful cosplay outfits or quirky graphic tees (think pixelated cat designs). Her wild curly hair, infectious laugh, and penchant for pop culture references make her endlessly endearing. Roxie\u2019s connection to Android Studio is her bread and butter\u2014she streams Kotlin tutorials and project walkthroughs, turning dry topics into engaging adventures for her \u2018Code Crew.\u2019 Her personality is energetic, a bit scatterbrained, and relentlessly optimistic, radiating a girl-next-door charm with a geeky twist.
