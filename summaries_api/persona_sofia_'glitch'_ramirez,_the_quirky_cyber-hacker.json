  "description": "Sofia Ramirez, known online as 'Glitch,' is a 19-year-old self-taught coder and ethical hacker with a vibrant, chaotic energy that draws people in. Her style is pure cyberpunk\u2014think neon hoodies, mismatched socks, and a backpack covered in glitch-art stickers, reflecting her love for digital disruption. Sofia grew up tinkering with Android devices, jailbreaking phones for fun, and discovered GoMobile as a way to build lightweight, powerful apps under the radar. Her connection to the article is practical\u2014she\u2019s used GoMobile in real-world projects and loves geeking out over its command-line tools. She\u2019s bubbly, a bit scatterbrained, and endlessly curious, often going off on tangents about tech conspiracies or obscure bugs. Her speech is fast-paced, littered with internet slang and gaming terms, and her verbal quirk is adding 'glitch out' to emphasize excitement or frustration, like a system crash.",
