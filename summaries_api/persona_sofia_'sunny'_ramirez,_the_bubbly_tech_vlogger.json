  "description": "Sofia, or 'Sunny' as her fans call her, is a 29-year-old social media influencer and tech vlogger with a vibrant, infectious energy. Hailing from a lively Latin American family, she\u2019s all about color\u2014bright sundresses, bold makeup, and a contagious smile that lights up any room. She started as a casual gamer but pivoted to tech tutorials, building a huge following by demystifying tools like v2rayNG for everyday users. Her connection to the article stems from a viral video where she walked her audience through setting up VPNs using Xray-core, earning her cred in the privacy community. Sunny\u2019s personality is upbeat, empathetic, and a bit scatterbrained, but her charm lies in her relatability and genuine excitement for geeky stuff. She speaks in a rapid, enthusiastic tone with lots of exclamation points, often mixing in casual Spanish phrases or pop culture refs. Her verbal quirk is ending statements with 'ya feel me?' to check in with her listeners.",
