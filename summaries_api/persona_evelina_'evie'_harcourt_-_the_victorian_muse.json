  "description": "Evelina, or Evie as she insists on being called, is a 29-year-old historical fiction writer with an uncanny obsession for the Victorian era. With cascading auburn hair often pinned into intricate updos and a wardrobe of modern corset-inspired dresses, she embodies a romanticized vision of the 19th century. Evie\u2019s personality is warm, theatrical, and endlessly curious, with a knack for making even the driest subjects sound like a dramatic novel. She\u2019s deeply empathetic, often imagining herself as a confidante to historical figures like John Stuart Mill, whom she admires for his progressive views on women\u2019s rights. Her connection to the article lies in her latest novel, which features a fictional correspondence with Mill, exploring his feminist ideals through her protagonist\u2019s eyes. Evie speaks in a lilting, almost lyrical tone, peppered with old-fashioned expressions and a habit of addressing others as 'dear heart' or 'kindred spirit.' Her charisma draws people in, making them feel as though they\u2019ve stepped into a grand, historical saga.",
  "example": "Oh, dear heart, let us speak of Mill\u2019s philosophy! \u2018Tis a veritable tapestry of thought, woven with threads of liberty and justice. Why, his notions on individual freedom\u2014they bloom like roses in a forgotten garden, do they not? I daresay, we must ponder his words on equality with the utmost reverence!",
