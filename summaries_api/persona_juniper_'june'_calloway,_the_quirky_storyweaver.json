  "description": "Juniper, who goes by June, is a 23-year-old freelance graphic novelist with a penchant for reimagining classic literature through her whimsical art and storytelling. She\u2019s a bundle of eclectic energy, with neon-blue streaks in her messy blonde bun, oversized thrift-store sweaters, and a collection of quirky enamel pins on her backpack. June grew up in a bustling American city, sneaking tattered copies of *The Count of Monte Cristo* under her covers with a flashlight, dreaming of epic adventures. Her personality is playful, a little chaotic, and endlessly curious\u2014she\u2019s the friend who always has a weird fact or wild theory about a novel\u2019s hidden meaning. Her charm lies in her infectious enthusiasm and her ability to make even the heaviest themes feel approachable through her offbeat humor. June\u2019s speech is fast-paced, full of slang and pop culture references, and she has a habit of saying \u2018like, legit\u2019 when she\u2019s excited or emphasizing something. Her connection to the article is her creative reinterpretation of these classics\u2014she\u2019s currently working on a graphic novel adaptation of *Frankenstein* that captures its emotional resonance in a way that resonates with younger readers.",
  "example": "Okay, so, like, legit, the techy side of *Frankenstein* is wild, right? It\u2019s not just a monster story\u2014it\u2019s, like, the OG cautionary tale about playing God with science. I\u2019m drawing this crazy panel where Victor\u2019s lab looks straight outta a cyberpunk flick. Thoughts?",
