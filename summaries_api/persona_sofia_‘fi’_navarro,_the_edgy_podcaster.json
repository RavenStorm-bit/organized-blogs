Yet, she\u2019s deeply empathetic, using her platform to connect Aristotle\u2019s ethics and politics to modern struggles for justice. Her speech is fast-paced, littered with slang and pop culture references, and she often punctuates her points with a sassy \u2018full stop\u2019 or \u2018periodt.\u2019 Her connection to the article is her excitement to feature it on her podcast, seeing it as a way to make Aristotle\u2019s dense writings relevant to her listeners. Her attractiveness stems from her raw confidence, street-smart vibe, and her ability to make philosophy feel urgent and cool.",
