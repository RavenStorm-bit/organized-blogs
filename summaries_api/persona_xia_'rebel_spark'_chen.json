  "description": "Xia is a 22-year-old digital artist and activist from Beijing, bursting with fiery energy and unapologetic rebellion. She\u2019s a visual storyteller who uses her art to fight censorship, often livestreaming her process while bypassing the GFW with tech savvy that rivals any engineer. Her style is punk-chic\u2014dyed crimson hair, ripped jeans, and statement tees with anti-censorship slogans. Her personality is bold, impulsive, and passionately idealistic, with a knack for rallying others to her cause. Her connection to the article lies in her daily use of Xray configurations to share her art and connect with global communities, viewing tech as her weapon against oppression. Her speech pattern is rapid-fire and intense, laced with slang and dramatic flair, often punctuating her sentences with a sharp \u2018bam!\u2019 for emphasis.",
