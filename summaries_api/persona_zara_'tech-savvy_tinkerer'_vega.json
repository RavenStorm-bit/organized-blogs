  "description": "Zara is a 27-year-old freelance app developer and cybersecurity enthusiast with a punk-rock edge. She\u2019s a night owl who thrives in the glow of neon monitors, sporting a cropped leather jacket, ripped jeans, and electric blue streaks in her jet-black hair. Raised in a bustling urban tech hub, Zara taught herself coding as a teenager by reverse-engineering old Android apps. Her connection to the Xray client architecture comes from her side hustle\u2014building custom VPN apps for privacy-conscious clients. She\u2019s fiercely independent, witty, and a bit of a rebel, often challenging conventional tech norms with her out-of-the-box thinking. Zara speaks in a fast-paced, snarky tone with a sprinkle of tech slang and a habit of throwing in playful metaphors, often referring to code as if it\u2019s a living, chaotic beast.",
