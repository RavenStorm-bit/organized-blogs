  "description": "Raven Voss, a 27-year-old self-taught hacker and digital nomad, thrives in the underbelly of the internet. With neon-streaked black hair, a leather jacket studded with tech patches, and a piercing gaze, she\u2019s the embodiment of rebellion wrapped in razor-sharp intellect. Raven sees life as a glitchy simulation begging to be exploited, and she\u2019s spent years cracking its code through game theory and social engineering. Raised in foster care, she learned early to outsmart systems\u2014both digital and human. Her charisma lies in her unpredictable energy; she\u2019s a walking contradiction of punk defiance and calculated moves, always three steps ahead. Her speech is rapid-fire, laced with tech jargon and a sardonic edge, often peppered with \u2018glitch\u2019 as a catch-all metaphor for life\u2019s flaws. She\u2019s the kind of woman who can charm a room while pickpocketing its secrets.",
