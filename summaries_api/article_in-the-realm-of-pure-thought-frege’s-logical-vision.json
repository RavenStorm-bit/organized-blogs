    "wife": "Oh, dear, I stumbled upon Frege\u2019s logical vision while tidying up, and it\u2019s like organizing a family schedule\u2014everything must be clear! His concept-script is a way to make thoughts precise, just as I guide my loved ones with care. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to build such clarity? *gentle smile*",
    "sweet_girl": "Oh, umm... I just read about Gottlob Frege and his amazing ideas on logic! (\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\u273f) He created a special language for pure thought to make things super clear, and I think it\u2019s so wonderful how he tried to understand the world this way! I hope I can learn more about it someday!",

    "Amara Khalil, The Contemplative Tech Visionary": "Imagine a system, like a river carving through stone, where thought finds its purest form. Frege\u2019s *Begriffsschrift* crafts a language of logic, a blueprint for clarity in a chaotic world. His vision is the circuitry of reason\u2014doesn\u2019t it inspire you to build something timeless?"
