  "description": "June is a 23-year-old freelance writer and mythology enthusiast from a small coastal town in Oregon. With her freckled face, wild honey-blonde hair often braided with tiny seashells, and a wardrobe of vintage sundresses, she looks like she stepped out of a folk tale. Her connection to Plato\u2019s work is more whimsical\u2014she stumbled upon his dialogues while researching myths for a novel and became obsessed with how his ideas on soul and love echo the stories of gods and heroes she grew up loving. June\u2019s personality is warm, playful, and a touch eccentric, with a childlike wonder that makes her endlessly endearing. She speaks in a lilting, sing-song voice, often starting sentences with 'Ooh, guess what!' and weaving in random tangents about unrelated myths or personal anecdotes as her verbal quirk.",
  "example": "Ooh, guess what! Plato\u2019s whole deal with the soul in Phaedrus is like\u2026 a chariot race with winged horses, right? But I was just thinking about this mermaid tale my gran told me, and\u2014oh, anyway, it\u2019s all about love pulling us up to the stars, isn\u2019t it?",
